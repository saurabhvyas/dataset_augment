hello I hope you've come here with low
expectations and minimal excitement
because things are about to get mildly
interesting but if you think about it
you know that's actually not so bad in
comparison to other YouTube videos
because how often do you start one and
you're like yeah this isn't really
interesting on to the next thing so if
this is at least mildly interesting it's
kind of a success so hey let's take a
look at the last month of things that
are kind of mildly interesting this row
of trees makes a perfect fall colors
progression bar huh that it does that's
that's really cool that's perfect
actually I wonder if there's some kind
of scientific phenomena going on like
there's a building that gives all of
them just asserted like slants and so it
gives them a particular amount of Sun
per tree to make this happen or if it's
purely coincidental but that's like that
seems too perfect to be coincidental
maybe they water them a certain amount
one gets more than the other and then I
don't know but that's that's pretty
incredible nothing is written in stone
written in stone you know I hate to ruin
the coincidental illusion but I feel
like it's done being self-aware as a
joke but it's yeah it's kind of funny
nothing is written in stone well if that
was the case this would be blank then so
okay congratulations you've just played
yourself paint chipping making the
wheelchair guy look like an angry old
man it's taken inspiration from the old
dude and happy wheels that's what we're
going for here it's just nature is is
doing it someone could fill in the
blanks with paint and try to make this
wheelchair thing have a cost it's gonna
cost play as the old dude from Happy
Wheels you know just in time for
Halloween we can have the handicapped
icon do some cosplaying it's only fair
my two-year-old brother wiped his face
on the couch after crying
Jesus Christ that's horrifying ha it's a
mildly interesting that's mildly
horrifying hey again just in time for
Halloween I hope it stains too and just
every time you sit or look at that couch
she was like okay yeah I remember that
one time that it was possessed by a
demon we're just gonna get rid of it now
good god and then there's a little mini
demon over there it's like he got the he
got the big face plant right there and
then wiped it off then did a little mini
face plant you know how after crying you
have the few stutters and then and then
he tried to bury that into the couch
again and then he was like alright I
guess I'm done with my tantrum it's fine
I'll get ice cream another night I don't
know what else is he crying about what
do kids cry about ice cream not getting
a new iPhone I don't know the way in my
closet separates this light huh from the
thumbnail it looked like some crazy and
or dimensional portal thing going on I
wonder how that works when there's no
glass or anything like that what's it
actually what is acting as a prism here
is it the strands of the carpet that are
like translucent and splitting up the
light 1970s album cover I mean yeah Dark
Side of the Moon action going on or
something but can we get a any any
information scientifically here as to
what's going on nothing scientific just
people making puns and stuff which is
kind of what you expect this guy's shirt
has the entire script of Pulp Fiction
printed on it like how do you even get a
printer to do that because there's just
like no margins it's just a hundred
percent and print it all over the place
where do you start reading it from also
our scripts are really that small that
you can fit the entire thing on a
t-shirt and is it front and back or just
I have so many questions
I wonder how close he would have to get
to actually realize this because I'm
sure the guy taking the photo had to ask
hey what's on your shirt and then the
guy was like oh it's a script to pulp
fiction although I'd be very very
impressed with the person taking the
photo was just sitting behind this
person like yes I do believe that is the
script for pulp fiction I did notice
that one section where it
says do does he look like a bitch yeah I
was very easy to identify
alright this magnet on my fridge in the
garage has been collecting the iron out
of the air I feel like that should be I
don't know a warning sign perhaps that
maybe you should use a face mask when
walking around in your garage because
apparently you have iron particles just
flying through the air and those
probably aren't good to breathe never
see those will it blend the videos every
time he opened the thing it would be
like iPhone dust don't breathe this and
I feel like you're breathing that yeah
are you doing something that involves a
lot of iron Dustin nope
just living in Oklahoma all right so
just living in Oklahoma
apparently you inhale iron hey no need
to eat beef or anything you get your
iron directly into your lungs Taiwanese
man has tiny pants for pockets okay I
was I was like trying to envision what
this meant from the description okay
it's just pockets that I made to look
kind of like pants which seems really
inconvenient because what if you put
your keys in there instead of just
having a a nice flat bottom that you can
easily reach and grab your keys can fall
into either pant leg of the pocket and
then what do you do you have to like get
tweezers and dig in there in order to
get your keys out but also who puts
their keys in their back pocket that
would be like mildly uncomfortable also
what have you sat on it and the key was
sticking it straight in here but and
then you wouldn't paled your butt all
that would suck I never put anything in
my back pockets so nice fake skylight in
the surgery waiting room ladies and
gentlemen this is the this is the future
of apocalypse bunkers you'll see the sky
from monitors inside them and that'll be
your only remembrance of of what the
outside world once looked like it's nice
but also it's kind of depressing at the
same time
like oh yeah outside but it's it's fake
but also a nice touch I suppose but it
probably looks weird if you're directly
under it I'm sure for a steal it looks
fine but in real life with 3d walking
around it's probably weird we had our
last box of seasoning so long that the
number of years on the label has now
changed Old Bay seasoning for seafood
poultry salad same great taste for over
70 years same great taste for over 75
years I've always wondered actually this
is rib this is amazingly mildly
interesting and something I've thought
about before like when you have
companies that say since whatever date
it seems more effective than saying for
the last some odd years because it's
always the date that you started that's
never gonna change but you say we've
been going for such-and-such length of
time
you always have to update that and every
time I see it I'm like I wonder what
wonder how long ago they actually
started because what if they haven't
updated that number in 10 years you know
you never do you never know you know but
you never do know right you know anyway
my colleague has a microfiber cloth to
clean his get glasses stitched under his
shirt is your colleague like the he's
like the button-up version of Steve Jobs
[Laughter]
instead of the black turtleneck he's got
the black turtleneck button up and he
buttons the buttons all the way up on
that thing dudes dudes full-on buttoned
up there anyway but that's it's a clever
idea I actually think that'd be very
useful especially like ola if you have
glasses but if you also use cameras a
lot just to have the ability to clean
your lens without worried just stitched
onto your shirt it's not a bad idea this
tree I found hiking looks like a forest
monster watching over you that's just I
don't like that man if I stumbled upon
that shit going for a pee in the middle
of the night if that was at a campground
I don't even think I'd have time to put
away what was going on I'd run I I'd run
while peeing I'm not
a person who buys into ghosts or any
supernatural or monsters or any of that
stuff but I see that in the middle of
the night know I'm dipping out of there
that's I'm not about that this box I
encountered on my school's campus while
going for a walk last night I mean is
that is that mildly interesting I guess
you encountered a fox and that's kind of
cool and that's nature but our Fox is
really rare to see I guess they are I
guess I've never actually seen a fox in
the wild so yeah I assume they run away
from you if you get close to them at
almost like a domesticated one but
that's that's a that's a fox
you are indeed correct sir this
restaurant has a painting of their very
first customers - gentleman's why -
gentleman's why very first customers is
the restaurant called - gentleman's why
it's a bizarre restaurant named yellow
with their let's go to the - gentlemen
why is that what is that like the hold
on why do y Y chromosome makes male or
I'm whatever the interesting restaurant
aim but yeah hey dude you know what if I
was if I open the restaurant and I was
like yeah super proud of this and it
wasn't a line out the door for a grand
opening or something there's just we're
hoping people come in I'd take a picture
of my first customers and be like can we
can we make this a permanent thing I'd
be totally down got it take pride in
your work I'm sure they invested a lot
of time making the restaurant happen so
restaurants were a risky business so you
gotta do what you can
someone had all the failed presidential
candidates bumper stickers on that car
oh my god all right so the real question
here is or they applied before or after
the election because if they were
applied before the election then who
needs news outlets spending millions of
dollars conducting polls to try to
figure out who's president we just go to
this guy and whoever he wants to put on
his car the opposite person is gonna win
that's all you need to know that's it
dude that would be mega impressive if
this person applied all those bumper
stickers before the election but there's
also probably a good chance that maybe
they got a few and they're like damn all
these people are losing maybe I'll just
turn it into a thing and so then they
decided to start applying the stickers
after the election but you know you can
hope that this person actually has the
world's worst prediction sense
my roommate spatula has a stand so that
the bit touches that touches your food
doesn't touch the counter oh my god oh
my god that's the grow my this is this
is a perpetual thing in my life is like
what do I do I need to always if I don't
have a plate to put my silverware over I
need to put it somewhere I can't go down
on the counter used to go down on a
napkin it needs to go down on a non
reusable surface or if it's reusable
something that was just washed but I
never I never like to put my salary down
on the table oh my god this is the best
thing ever I wish they all silverware
just had a little dangly do Hicker
like this it really add to the
complexity of a normal fork knife spoon
etc but man would that be the bet I
would buy that in a heartbeat when I'm
taking food down from upstairs I got my
to go thing as I'm opening the key like
before I've opened the container I got
to put the fork somewhere I usually try
to put it on a napkin but sometimes I
don't have napkin because I know it's
not gonna be messy and then what do I do
I love this I love this so much three
girls in the same row wearing the same
color sweater with same color hair yeah
I wasn't no world that's like some
visual deja vu right there they had to
have coordinated that that's just weird
like hold on damn I do I have mirrors in
front of me
am I seeing into a duplicate dimension
no it's just okay so watch they're
actually triplets and pair the parents
just love to coordinate them in the same
outfit I've seen twins before they dress
the same and it's just weird I'm sorry
if anyone watching this is a twin and
you guys like dressing up the same but
that's what yeah that's mildly
interesting for sure my friend's phone
case blends in with his 1982 school
library circulation desk it's like a
perfect match what the hell what what in
the world you know that the way that
this happened is like dude just put his
phone down not thinking and then looked
at it was like where'd my phone go and
found it a few seconds later was like
wasn't lit wait what it lines up
perfectly I wonder if it was actually a
photo was taken of that desk because I
mean you got to assume that it's just
it's a laminate it's a vinyl laminate
that has the same print on it for every
single desk and so I wonder if it's just
the common desk and I'm like alright
let's take a photo and turn it into I
want to know the reasoning behind this
but that's okay
there we go pretty cool pretty mildly
interesting ly cool
anyway that was it for the last month
mildly interesting I was mildly
interested how about you anyway uh check

a
a
good morning and welcome to my world
unknown point is already discussed in
Sometimes the matrix
Maybe if you are the first time
I heard about it
I wonder what is the Matrix
this video
We will explain that the matrix is a
mind and what happens inside
but before saying it is a mind
let's tell where it comes from this
idea
you will see everything around us
the monitor that you have in front of such
Once the smartphone or possibly
tablet is not real does not exist as such
They are simply frequencies
electromagnetic vibrating more or
less intensity you through
the senses can perceive their
these senses are delivered
our laboratory perceptions
It is in our brain and we believe and
We settle everything around us
we think there is this marker that
my hand and we think there
But what I can feel and smell touch
solely because
I created this matrix receiving all
the data generated by this marker and
ebro analyzing comics is not
Real is an electromagnetic frequency
vibrating at a different rate at
which can deliver a radio frequency
or frequency that vibrates
Example waves and microwaves is not
tangible
we simply found in his
same width or the same frequency and
They are able to touch what are the
as often as we are
within our matrix we see the
sevenths we take it and we all
what we do seem real without
But it is not
it speaks go to the old
cultures in one way or another they were
explaining what the ancient Hindus
They defined as the Maya so called
that universe created and generated by a
mind and said that the real
universe was behind the truth
It was called brack ma
It is very difficult to explain this concept
If you do not understand everything
we have around us is not what
It seems to be to control and
dominate the mesh to control and
master matrix is important that
you understand that is linked to
each and every one of the objects
exist
all you have in front of your wall
your keyboard
perhaps the chair is part of a whole
we create the idea that we are
separate each person and each
group is a kind of unit when
Actually everything is kind of block
living within a simulation
immense which it is created by a mind
these concepts may be
difficult to understand you but you
I will give an example very clear if you
You want to create this pen and has
no plastic material has
ink and has no money to
buy as believes area
with your mind you can create anything
with your mind , in your imagination
You can have a pen like
we create with our minds one
mind above us has
created a mind from which we will
talk
we are part of a thought and that
mind has to turn over and over by
and above this world or those worlds
we develop our imagination
they turn others and others
the matrix is a mind that thinks we
we create our matrix
thoughts
we form and are creators of
the matrix
but our matrix has been stolen
Unfortunately things are not
as they should be we will explain
what happened to the matrix
To understand this concept is
important that you understand
previously an example that I'm going to
I'm going to put a couple of them put
This way you will understand how is
configured the matrix
3 in the universe or in our universe
there are intelligent entities other than
We loved that we could call
located at a higher level
we and others at a lower level
To understand this concept of how
these beings function
I will say that things or issues
They are as follows Louis
First on top
we could say that they are a
beings that we call the
first order
the first order we will do as you
it was a pyramid structure these
beings first order
let's call them beings 0
There are other beings just below
we can call these beings
one level below these there are other
also intelligent beings with minds
They are able to create these beings
level 2 and below these are
other beings who can also create
They are beings Level 3
quite possibly the matrix of the universe
is much deeper up and
much deeper down but
let's focus on our reality
in what surrounds us these beings
top are the source
the original seed source mind
Primal is what creates us
first child breaks for you to understand
This concept will explain this
so when you have one in front
computer or a smartphone or a tablet
as I said earlier and that there
some icons appears the menu
maybe listening to music options Video
not magically comes out of that unit has
I had to be programmed and that
Programming has levels
at the beginning of programming
find the edge and hard work will
draw a chip that chip
say it is the support on which
the programming focus
let's talk now
this chip is programmed with binary
zeros and ones
this would be the source source code
and switches seed that
on and off
in one way or another your phone has
million your computer hundreds of thousands
of millions and so on
the next level if you at the end of
all this long history is in
your tablet with a series of icons and
graphic possibilities can you
manipulate the following has occurred
someone has created what is called the
Assembler some call flesh
assembler
subsequently to program it
the tablet or the computer has created
the low - level languages
For example we could subsequently
talk about him the c + + co or could
speak of females
or we can speak of that next
level that exists to reach these
icons are high - level languages
these high - level languages by
example basic for example there is
They are much more complex as it
low thickens
and as accused reach the
top
the instructions are much more
simple
That's what happens there is a process for
you see this is that someone has
I had to program all this can not
whether it be before there has been no
this and this if there is not this
of course it all depends on the source
of the source of the origin called
Bragman
at the end you find yourself with that
Actually you see on your tablet does not stop
analyze what is behind
the code if it works or not or
instructions behind or how
operating from within that processor not
simply you handle the tablet
opening videos or listening to music
perhaps you are sending a message
so does the mind mind
It is peculiar human is peculiar because it has
It has been growing from inside to outside
our mind works as follows
way
We've talked on occasion if
we think this is a human mind
eg
He has grown precisely in this
address
in the central part are the
basic instincts what is called the
the reptile brain later
more complex functions up to
the intelligence is in the
outermost layer in the center
basic functions occur eat
sleep drink
then more complex functions
and finally the outside of the
analytical intelligence capable of
process all that information
analyze responses and reach
conclusions
It works the same way to the same
way math works if we
We realize the two plus two is four
They have reached physical developments
simply amazing theoretical
It means two field theories
relativity all is well
the universe is how it works scale
mind our body is well
our cells are made up
This genetic DNA chain that that
also called genetic code code
curiously this code creates a
cells and these cells create organs
and those bodies created the individual
part of this society and
matrix around us
as we see the examples are repetitive
simile is constant and we see
all the issues around us
military structure social structure
the employment structure
everything works structurally as ai
Indian
There are a number of things as I said
before the call these beings
as part of the original seed
the primal mind is we know very
some of it
we have very little data from this source
Here are our creators
the mind that created us and we thought we
He created from like us
We create a marker for what happens before
it was created by our mind and
our mind creates
the tablet that you have in front was
created by the mind of someone who
designed the tablet which in turn design
another person
its software that allows you to operate
someone she designed her battery
Internal because he thought his mind and
someone discovered that he could
store energy in batteries
because he thought his mind and
developments were more and more complex
to the point where we
someone thought we find ourselves and
someone took us created source code
and design the human being was his mind
who created us in some cultures and
civilizations
They call the Demiurge
In this part we find ourselves
this is the point at which being
human is if here is the
human being
and we also believe there are beings of
another level that are created with our
mind our imagination create
thoughts create living machines
in our mind are beings
third order and part of
thoughts are created in flat
astral and dependent on us
some of them become objects
Physical others they become
objects operating in astral planes
so that our reality is forged
formerly control these beings
it was done so naturally
routinely ancients had a
secret and sacred knowledge that was
lost with the arrival of
Regionalism makes about two thousand or three
perhaps a thousand years previously
used regularly but we
to talk about this part that creates being
human
This code does things
this code we will call it by
give it a name we can understand what
call scripts their
and
which is a script is a code script
You are running a program source within
the computer world and here we go
define equal humans creates
programs that create programs scripts
Actually we have with
our mind we see
all the good and bad
We forge our destiny are creators
our reality all that
you have bad it is because the scripts
you have created in your mind you have
led in that direction
what you are good and those
great achievements it has obtained is because
scripts and programs used
I believe in this universe and this
matrix led him towards the road
speak it goes wide mallet
I had so many physical CREPAD in the kart
olé
I come to mind right now by
rhonda byrne such youth doctor
william walton Buddha
all spoke of the same in the
antiquity with ancestral rites
heathen
for example created witchcraft
third-order entities operating at
our desires for creating scripts
program codes that were used
in favor of our desires
Over time these practices
They have been limited to small circles
These scripts can be positive or
They can be negative
these codes we created this program
we create our entities
We created in other planes in other planes
lower than ours can be
positive and operate on our behalf but
They can also be negative for
example blood sacrifice
achieve power and control that
Baal was god for instance
what he did was create scripts
evil entities that used the
deceit and cunning and the
cruelty to meet his master
kept alive because their master
He kept alive in his mind and with those
rites and the delivery of blood to them
fed and gave them power and turn
these beings our evil entities
fed power or giving his master
giving that control or calling
evil acts in some cases
this type
bill such issues if
They used positively most of the
Sometimes those ancient shamans
They knew they had to use this
type of system programming
bring rain in times of
Drought had to use it to
bring wealth and prosperity in the hunt
They had to create it to scare away
They are creating enemies such entities
for protection
They knew were programs operate
They used for good and
achieve health
abundance happiness
knowledge is dual and
Using this matrix by
our mind and creating these
Ideas so is
knew all this for example if
you have had the opportunity
surely you have seen many sites
as are incomprehensible and the
part for example of a higher
knoll we are mysteriously one
come
urbaneja who put it there because it
He puts there because they are energy points
where you are scripts where they were
their rites and knew that at these points
there was a mighty power
He amplifies those ideas that created
multiplying the reality they
created were formerly as I said
menhirs dolmens they used used
even ancient obelisks hermitage
placed in inhospitable sites because
in places that energy exuded
allowing greater control of that
and magic that we have to operate
correctly
and Zarathustra said that the worst of his
days was when he discovered the power
had to create things because if
that power not used properly
it would be their own destruction
when we want evil we feel bad
and we think that everything is going wrong and goes
a failure to lose health
I'm not financially well what
They do what you do is schedule
scripts telling the universe that
It is what I want really because
I talk about it because I think about it
constantly
the universe does not understand if you tell me
I do not want only understands poverty
poverty word because it is a verb and a
we have done when we talk
use language correctly and not
We can say I do not want poverty
I have to say I want wealth for
These programs work
ancients did correctly in
these places was the most powerful
They succeeded in getting energy hunting
They getting rain abundance using
correctly their strength and magic
and
While the following video program
We talk about the next program
we devote to the matrix talk
on third - degree entities
of course part of this matris
OCCUPY reptilians called as
I always say no more of this world
unknown point is we are in the
next video program soon
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
We missed you.
You like what I've done with the place.
It ends tonight.
I know it does, I've seen it.
That's why the rest of me is just gonna enjoy the show.
Cause we already know that I'm the one who beats you.
Can you feel it Mr.Anderson.
Closening in on you.
Who I can.
I really should thank you for it after all it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life.
Purpose of life is to end.
so now we're going to find the inverse
of a 3x3 matrix so here we have a 3x3
matrix a and the first thing we're going
to do is find the determinant of this
matrix a and the way I like to find the
determinant is just by copying the first
two columns and placing them on the
right side of the matrix so we'll start
with this first column right here I'm
going to copy it and place it to the
right of the matrix so notice how I copy
the numbers 1 0 5 and I placed them to
the right side of the matrix and now I'm
going to do the same exact thing with
the column 2 I'm going to copy it and
place it to the right side of the matrix
now by copying these two columns
notice how I'm able to create three
diagonals I have one diagonal right here
I have another diagonal right here and I
have another diagonal right here what we
need to do is we need to multiply the
numbers in all three diagonals so that's
what I'm going to do right now in this
first diagonal we have 1 1 and 0 so I'm
going to multiply all those numbers
together 1 times 1 is just 1 1 times 0
is 0 and in the second diagonal we have
2 times 5 which is 10 and 10 times 5
which is 50 and in the third diagonal we
have 3 times 0 which is 0 0 times 6 is
also 0 and after we multiply these
diagonals we need to do the exact same
thing with the diagonals going the
opposite way so notice how we have three
diagonals going the opposite way we have
one right here we have one right here
and we have one right here and if we
multiply these diagonals together
starting with the first one we have 5
times 1 which is 5 5 times 3 is 15 in
the second diagonally we have 6 times 5
which is 30 30 times 1 is also 30 and in
the third diagonal we have 0 times 0
which is 0 0 times 2 is also 0 so now to
find the determinant of matrix a the
only thing that we need to do is take
the
red numbers and add them together and
then subtract them from all the green
numbers so with our red numbers we have
a zero eight positive 50 and another
zero and we need to subtract the red
numbers from the green numbers and the
green numbers are positive 15 positive
30 and zero so the determinant of matrix
a is equal to zero plus 50 plus 0 which
is just 50 minus 15 plus 30 which is 45
50 minus 45 is just equal to 5 so the
determinant of matrix a is equal to 5 so
after we find our determinant we have to
find what I like to call a new matrix so
let's just call our new matrix n so how
do we know what goes inside of our new
matrix n so let's take a look at our
original matrix a let's take a look at
the number in the top left position this
number 1 if we cross out the row and the
column of this number 1 notice how we're
left with a 2 by 2 matrix 1 5 6 0 so in
the top left position we need to copy
that 2 by 2 matrix and put 1 5 6 0 so
now we need to do the same exact thing
for every number in the matrix a so now
we'll move on to the top middle number
this number 2 if we cross out the row
and the column of this number 2 we're
left with a 2 by 2 matrix 0 5 &amp; 5 0 so
I'm going to copy that 2 by 2 matrix and
place it in the top middle position 0 5
5 0 so now let's do the same thing for
the number in the top right position
this number 3 if we cross out
row and the column of the number three
we're left with a 2 by 2 matrix 0 1 5 6
so I'm going to copy that 2 by 2 matrix
in the top right position 0 1 5 6 so now
let's do the same exact thing for the
number in the middle left position this
number 0 if we cross out the row and the
column of this number 0 we're left with
the 2 by 2 matrix 2 3 6 0 so I'm going
to copy that 2 by 2 matrix in the middle
left position 2 3 6 0 so now let's do
the same as our thing for our middle
number which is 1 I'm going to cross out
the row and the column of this number 1
and we're left with the 2 by 2 matrix 1
3 5 0 so I'm going to copy that 2 by 2
matrix in the middle 1 3 5 0 so now
let's do the same thing for the number
in the middle right position this number
5 if we cross out the column and the row
of this number 5 we're left with the 2x2
matrix 1 2 5 6 so I'm going to copy that
2x2 matrix into our middle right
position 1 2 5 6 now if we do the same
thing for the number in the bottom left
position this number 5 we cross out the
column and the row of this number 5
we're left with the 2x2 matrix 2 3 1 5
so I'm going to copy that 2x2 matrix in
the bottom left position 2 3 1 5 and
moving on to the number in the bottom
middle position this number 6 if we
cross out the column and the row of this
number 6 we're left with a 2 by 2 matrix
1 3 0 5 so I'm going to copy that
2 by 2 matrix in the bottom middle
position 1 3 0 5
and finally we can move on to our number
in the bottom right position this number
zero if we cross out the column and the
row of this number zero we're left with
a two by two matrix 1 2 0 1 so I'm going
to copy that 2 by 2 matrix in the bottom
right position 1 2 0 1 and now we have
filled our new 3x3 matrix n with a bunch
of smaller two-by-two matrices so now we
can move on to our next step
our next step is we need to replace our
new matrix n with the determinants of
all these two-by-two matrices so we'll
start with the matrix in the top left
corner to find the determinant of a 2 by
2 matrix you just need to multiply this
diagonal and then multiply this diagonal
and then subtract the both so that's
what I'm going to do right now we have 1
times 0 which is 0 and we have 5 times 6
which is 30 0 minus 30 is equal to
negative 30 now we'll move on to the top
middle matrix we have 0 times 0 which is
0 and 5 times 5 which is 25 0 minus 25
is negative 25 now we'll move on to the
top right corner we have 0 times 6 which
is 0 and 5 times 1 which is 5 0 minus 5
is equal to negative 5 now moving on to
the middle left we have 2 times 0 which
is 0 and 3 times 6 which is 18 0 minus
18 is negative 18 moving on to the
middle matrix we have 1 times 0 which is
0 3 times 5 which is 15 0 minus 15 is
negative 15 moving on to the
middle-right matrix we have 1 times 6
which is 6 and 2 times 5 which is 10 6
minus 10 is equal to negative 4 moving
on to the bottom left matrix we have 2
times 5 which is equal to 10 we have 3
times 1 which is 3 10 minus 3 is equal
to positive 7
when we go into the bottom middle matrix
we have 1 times 5 which is 5 3 times 0
which is 0 5 minus 0 is equal to
positive 5 and moving on to the bottom
right we have 1 times 1 which is equal
to 1 and 2 times 0 which is equal to 0 1
minus 0 is equal to positive 1 so now we
have replaced our matrix n with the
determinants of all these 2 by 2
matrices so moving on to our next step
we need to alternate positive and
negative signs in our matrix so if we
start in the top left position we'll
start with a positive sign then we got
to alternate to a negative positive
negative positive negative positive
negative and positive so now I'm going
to scroll down just a bit just to give
myself a little bit more space so now if
we simplify our matrix n we have a
positive and a negative 30 the positive
and negative gives us a negative number
we have a negative negative 25 two
negatives gives us a positive 25 we have
a positive negative 5 so that just stays
negative 5 we have a negative negative
18 two negatives gives us a positive 18
we have a positive negative 15 so that
just stays as a negative 15 we have a
negative negative 4 two negatives gives
us a positive 4 we have a plus 7 so that
just stays positive 7 we have a negative
5 so that just stays negative 5 and we
have a plus 1 so that just stays
positive 1 so now we can move on to our
next step
our next step is we need to reflect all
the numbers along this red diagonal
which I'm drawing right now and if we
reflect all the numbers across this red
diagonal all the numbers that are
actually laying on that diagonal are
going to stay in the same position so
the numbers that are on the diagonal
negative 30 negative 50
and positive one they're gonna stay in
the same position negative 30 negative
15 and positive 1 and if we reflect the
number 18 and a number 25 along this red
diagonal then they're going to switch
places so this number 18 is going to go
where the 25 used to be and this number
25 is going to go where the number 18
used to be and if we reflect this number
7 and this number negative 5 across the
red diagonal then they're going to
switch places so the negative 5 is going
to go where the positive 7 used to be
and the positive 7 is gonna go where the
negative 5 used to be and I think you
get the idea by now if we reflect these
numbers across the red diagonal the
negative 5 and the positive 4 we're
going to switch places so the positive 4
is going to go where the negative 5 used
to be and the negative 5 is going to go
where the positive 4 used to be so now
we have completely found our new matrix
n and the nice thing about this matrix
is that it allows us to find the inverse
of our matrix a quite easily so I'm just
going to scroll down a little bit just
to give myself a little bit more space
so the formula for the inverse of our
matrix a is equal to 1 over the
determinant of a all multiplied by this
matrix n that we just found so we know
from earlier that the determinant of a
was 5 so 1 over the determinant of a is
going to be 1 over 5 and we know that
our matrix n is equal to negative 30 18
positive 7 so we have negative 30 18
positive 7 then we have 25 negative 15
negative 5 so we have 25 negative 15
negative 5 and we have negative 5 4
one negative five four and one and last
but not least this one over five is a
scalar so we need to multiply this by
the entire matrix so I'm going to scroll
down once again just to give myself a
little bit more space the inverse matrix
a is equal to one over five times
negative 30
which is negative 30 over 5 or negative
6 1 over 5 times 18 is just 18 over 5 1
over 5 times 7 is equal to 7 over 5 1
over 5 times 25 is 25 over 5 or just 5 1
over 5 times negative 15 is negative 15
over 5 or negative 3 1 over 5 times
negative 5 is negative 5 over 5 or just
negative 1 1 over 5 times negative 5 is
also negative 1 1 over 5 times 4 is 4
over 5 and 1 over 5 times 1 is just 1
over 5 so congratulations now we have
found the inverse of matrix a we've
probably spent over 10 minutes doing it
which a computer could probably do in
less than a second

you ever watched the movie one of the matrix

great because what matters is not what

you want the blue pill you will have
to go through an ordeal for
understand the reality that certainly
just like in the film matrix when
he chooses that blue pill begins
suffering is to be purged of
cables it needs to go through a period
adaptation of understanding why
never walked in his life and never felt the
things as they are just that
offering for you and this
perception of reality as it is only
It comes through knowledge you will
behind that knowledge will prefer
keep watching the reality that
about the way it is presented and
presents totally distorted by
subjective perceptions of each
individuals who aim to take
an end of class struggle be it
which fo the red pill blue pill
you choose
The Matrix is a system neo that system
is our enemy when you're inside we look
around what do you see businessmen
teachers lawyers carpenters the very
minds of the people we are trying to
save but until we do these people are
still a part of that system
and that makes them our enemy have to
understand most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged and many of them
are so nerd' so hopelessly dependent on
the system that they will fight to
protect it
are you listening to me neo or were you
looking at the woman in the red dress I
was look again please it this this isn't
the matrix No
it's another training program designed
to teach you one thing if you are not
one of us you are one of them
what are they sentient programs they can
move in and out of any software still
hardwired to their system that means
that anyone we haven't unplugged is
potentially an agent inside the matrix
they are everyone and they are no one
we are survived by hiding from them by
running from them but they are the
gatekeepers they are guarding all the
doors they are holding all the keys
which means that sooner or later someone
is going to have to fight them someone I
won't lie to you new every single man or
woman who has stood their ground every
one who has fought an agent has died but
where they have failed you will succeed
why I've seen an agent punch through a
concrete wall men have emptied entire
clips at them and hit nothing but air
yet their strength and their speed are
still based in a world that is built on
rules because of that they will never be
as strong or as fast if you can be what
are you trying to tell me that I can
dodge bullets no neo I'm trying to tell
you that when you're ready you won't
have to
we got trouble

He changed the prophecy and forced

based on previous explanations

I learned that the choice of storage

incorrect
I also informed that now has the

You can end the war and defeat

smith realize that with worldwide

an apparent never ending battle to fight

equality
as I could not defeat new
and while new realized he could not
win this battle with nothing to lose
31 with the death and everything to gain by
humanity and intentionally
sacrifices that sending smith win
between that smith pet thousand but
nilton added smith shows cracks in
neck and begins to explode and all
mit other snakes in the matrix do
same
eventually the virus is fully
eliminated from the matrix of this software
destruction process apparently
destroys smith and level of consciousness
also
but there are suspicions that a thousand have
survived because the machine sees
while his body is taken by
brands while rehearsing machines
interrupted his attack and sneaks in
Peace answer no purpose
and the peace
I had also negotiated any
human mind to become conscious
the nature of the matrix would be allowed
freedom without interference
just before the end of the film we see a
Black Cat in the year under a school
destroyed
this was an allusion to a scene newey
a black cat that appears twice in the
first movie
an indication that something has been
changed within the matrix code
for this was a new experience
jaú at the end follow a dialogue
between the architect
draco and then with the website where this
last question is summer again
worse matches that probably yes
Now yes then refresh the memory
you with three of the plot summary
movies
we begin to understand the universe
matrix that revolutionized cinema and
science fiction in many ways
teaching reference manga anime
comics cyber culture
punk philosophy kung fu among others
several references
now I begin to explain the universe
matrix of your world as it happened
as the machines got the domain and
etc
bora there in the world matrix
We know it is a virtual reality type
the second Sims life is logical or
that much more evolved
it's like everything you see now the
around your computer only cup
coffee did not exist to become more
course is like the same game
as I mentioned before you are living
in this game but without knowing
get an individual out of the matrix is
it will go through a period of
recovery
their bodies never used for the eyes
doyle muscles are atrophied
recovery takes on average one
week there for it uses the
culture that carry active musicians
It recovers in a few days to come and
leaving the mother a need
operator are the people who care
equipment while people
They are within it and provide all
type of equipment that people
will need
Furthermore the operator responsible for
find a way out for people who
you can dial a phone or telephone one
apartment close to where people
They are transmitted out of the matrix in
matrix agents are men
Field robots
they have a duty to maintain order
revoked to anyone who may be
considered a threat
But there are many agents
destruction during its
performance is very violent
agents have strength and agility
unusual is virtually
impossible to destroy them because they are the
while everyone and no car
explain each person inserted in the matrix
It may be the host of the season
agents because they do not have a body
fixed
just a person see something your ordinary
around which the system calls for us
it enters the body
agents can even disconnect from
shots they will have black and glasses
dark
as well as a small headset for
where they receive contacts from other agents
now I get a little bit of
history before the movies or be a
Style is prelude is on a date
not officially between 2000 and
2010
scientists have created the first
computer with consciousness was
started the intelligence was
Artificial thereafter is
evolution of computers has exploded with
own computers designing
new computers increasingly
intelligence were then created the
first robots with humanoid form
initially they were not alike
with humans but calls the same training
corporal
this time most of the thefts was
used in services that do not stop
Household to search
genetics
this time they were updating
its forms becoming increasingly
like humans arrived one
time when it is impossible to distinguish
a year of a robot that was then
They began the disputes between humans and
robots as robots are required
treated the same way that humans and
not only as mere machines
I work where it was to be a
advancing the finished with a kick
machines rebelled and deciding
enslave humans then began a
war on this war marks
lasted several years until close to his
end in a final act of desperation
humanity shut the sky so much
sun things that robots
used solar energy to recharge
but they ran out off the bad
not realized that he could
use humans as a source own
energy for intelligence
Artificial since the human body
It produces a lot of energy to overcome the hurts
war
this real world and imprisoned
all humans in cocoons where they
They had power they need for
goals while they are trapped
this kind of live a cocoon
virtual reality
when the last and final version of the
kills to be made it did not work
correctly to 1% of humans
They were edited it some
They survived and have a design city
thefts want to find any
cost to eliminate the last outbreak of
human resistance to madrid had
some versions before reaching their
final the architect created the first
beta matrix based on their
concepts of reality
the first version was a version
perfect which prevented human
tennis bad feelings to
avoid a simulated reality
bring suffering to 21 years
humans do not accept your world
perfect without pain and without war
the program collapsed and much
people died an architect then created
second beta of matrix in which the
virtual environment reflects
distorted and harmful characteristics
human thinking they so
accept the program
ie the law of another world
matrix only now with thoughts
and bad feelings like hatred sadness
and in some humans also not
accepted obvious to a world of pain and
war
the program collapsed in much
people died again
the architect failed and does not understand why
to see that the architecture is unable to
solve the problem alone deus ex
machina so that third movie
analyzed the problem the problem was that the
Architect does not understand users
program that is human
deus ex machina took the decision to
create a problem to solve this
problem
he created a program whose purpose
It was to understand the human mind
serve as an aid to helping architect
keep the array in working
This program was called hole
the Romans battery service was
I need to accept a virtual world
as being real with all its
forces
then the architect was at fault
create many who did not accept one
natural process of things human
the oracle studied humans and
He realized that all flow into a single
Score
the choices from this point forward to
fulfill its purpose it was necessary
where this time how to
processed human choices
the oracle found that values
mind of man as belief
experience and just get feelings
connected to the social environment of the person
always point to a choice that
so the oracle to realize that once
you may have control over the values
Mental person automatically
change one's choice shaping
choice of man would not
reason for humans choose
reject the matrix system as the
beta 1 and b2 only this
control would not be 100% effective the
beliefs experiences stories
life experiences connected to means
Social person does not always
determine human choice because
one like right there is no
standard not always a means Valdin
hundreds by regions because so
mental analysis of the oracle is not 100%
must say it was 99% and oracles
knew that these 11 percent who still
They insist on rejecting the main movie
also they have their experiences
feelings and since we did not realize
without citing mental characteristics
They were molded Automatically
future things these 1% of people
They will also be molded
this way would be extremely easy
for brands produce a system
virtual that supported these people
whose existence was too strong
provided that the following rules be
followed pressure and only humans now
They should have a constant reminder of
war against the machines have
aware that once were freed
the matrix or are children of people
who were delivered Israel should be a
rather unpleasant place believe in a
supreme being to direct
hopes
all characteristics forcing the
zion people that these habitats
israel would be if 1 percent
accept the new virtual system that is
design is hollow ruben ritual system
now will pay attention you will
understand
from that moment be any
human that threatens the virtual system
mentally be eliminated by sentinel
keeping the system balance with
more time
israel so it is not the physical world
is a virtual world is a layer
layer design is connected to the layer
matrix through the software interface
who want to protocol and password to
communicate these interfaces matrix
They are represented well by phone
as the design are presented by
cranial plug the problem with this is
that by the time the creators can
call it is not know how
program a system where there is the
while control beliefs
experiences and life stories
feelings while this
system would be computationally
predictable in order to prevent this
number 1% increase with time
deus ex machina then created a program
whose purpose is to answer this
question this program was called
Meruge first video realize that
computational stability dilemma
would be fully resolved if a
simple program was placed
in all simulations forward there
the first video postulated that teaches
causality in the system matrix
work of self-managed mode by
own human actions
considering that the oracle could
analyze the mental characteristics that
so a choice first video
analyzing the consequences of this
choice that would automatically lead the
new choices with new consequences
the system will automatically run
without external intervention
causality made it possible to know
the future since they had information
reliable primary choice in case the
algorithm of causality was added to
program oracle causing it
gained power to predict the future as
can process human choice to
well as assessing the
consequences of these choices
through these choices and so
successively
the program number video has become so
dispensable to have lost its
purpose in matrix programs
defects which lose their function should
They are sent to be the source
raised essentially non programs
They were created to make the choice
however the entire program has
human environmental characteristics by
example is to pray conclusion cookies and
puts black love right
mean they think like machines
even if they were virgin human number
then sneaks into the system and adopts
new purpose the new purpose the
first video is becoming a
dealer information as
dominates the understanding of causality
but the domain understanding the choices
human being so it becomes
Limited provide just the facts whose
choices have already been made
he then wanted a base with problems
outdated or defects, as well as
it should be deleted and boot
all information contained therein
for further analysis and that's why
he speaks in the third film
bring me oracle and I will give them their
savior because he needs her
humans are easy
certainly with time missed a
strength and will to live and pedro
logical hope
so the oracle had in mind that
zion people direct their
hopes in a supreme ie the
Time did not realize that if the people
design will be the messiah who also
It was a year and fight for freedom and
perform miracles in the system would have their
invigorated forces every day to
create the chosen
the oracle
what the output would be hired from
anomaly in human choice in one
talking point
the hope would be one of the forces
mental that shaped the choice of
israel population in the war
the machines from the moment it is
mental feature was a choice
then the inhabitants of Zion not
They made freely choose
so the choice had already been made
that is why it is called the new
chosen he has no choice
all schools have already been made and
You should just understand them and accept them
with this other issue raised as
leave that responsibility in the hands of
but one year but would never do that and how
design people and would deliver
responsibilities in the hands of a
machine obviously they did not
they do it
then the only way to solve the
impasse was to create a program exactly
a simulation program one year
calm so perfect but so perfect
that by itself would believe program
it was one year the program should
believe it would be the savior
hope and freedom that we
that is what the architect realizes
he continues and irrevocably
human because even after being able
performing the matrix thing no
year could even after
corrupting the binary code of a
agent
even after clearly feel the
causality flow to states that 30
I would take a shot
I remember the dreams several times had
type functions forecasts still right
so he does not feel a program it
still I felt a year and was scheduled
out that way even the chosen
He worked the whole story for
machines unknowingly helping to shape
choices of the people but not design
Works chosen was much more
complex than that unlike
matrix in which people were conceived
Artificially keeping a control
population with the size of the machines
the site a problem for inhabitants
getting through sex
making it impossible to control by
machines
sooner or later Israel pull the error
radio that is needed to madrid
to stay connected
constant action was necessary
so the population of israel
reached the limit population
so the other function is a thousand
return to the source of his Semna
programming and re-enter the program
original
after that choose 23 people said
seven males used to rebuild the
to install array to the next
version to a tribe is in its sixth
official version which leads to complete
that there be six sessions the matrix
selected
ie there were six formatting of
design solutions which gives more
sure wish is virtual with
you really think brands
destroyed the year six times for logo
then rebuild it all over again
this fits with the predictions
uttered with your that there was a
man inside the matrix could do
amazing things and freed the
first human saying that one day would
come back
which is exactly what the architect
says for me to do
He followed refused the choice of such
people would no longer be formatted without
chance of being rebuilt and matrix
main break and causing the
humanity disappear at the end of the 1st
3
the agent was corrupt punished missing
its purpose and are consequently
forced to return to the source to be
deleted
so in my video displays fled to
within the system and took on a new
the purpose to convey destruction
matrix dominated he would have full access
the interfaces to access the site already
They wanted also part of
simulation ie it was not for the
real world as liu does not exercise
influence on brands in the world
only in the simulation but this was not
God's concern ex machina to
call zahia was not the main
problem is the main problem is that
smith would have been directly and that all
Programs related to matrix
ie the software in the real world
including true deus ex own
Machina which is connected to the matrix and
attackers
ie is not about saving where zaire
smith was about the maximum same mistake
two brands
smith could easily complete
his goal was not achieved the
caused mutation punished at the end of
first film allowed smith
making it impossible to evolve
isolate it this one way track
Matrix program able to defeat
smith would be a thousand
knowing that smith was out of control and
the program was able to defeat it new
deus ex machina makes a deal with 1000
for peace in Israel a cylinder
smith simply a copy instead of
new union programming code
continues in both autonomously maria
it means the same time that it
matt smith is not destroyed in this
occasion no later than the collapse
machine then takes the residue thereof
ground and month that Balsom and lead to
a basic concept right after all is not
needed for the near future and
System boot is another thing I found
Interestingly, even after
rise of the machines for the second
film shows that humans still
You have to use them type as shown
the scene in what happens in the design where
a machine control water and other
creates oxygen kind needed for
our survival
we have control over the machines
but the same exercise the same control

lack of energy is a source matrix and
analogy with Christianity right
there is a benign Trinity movie

this is one of the subtle messages that
Technology goes in their lines
however the main message
technology is a new concept of
truth in a dialogue asks me what
It is matrix answers you want to know
the matrix that madrid is in all
range is a world that believes to be real
so he did not realize the truth
true that you are a new slave
like everyone else you were born in
in captivity in a prison not
can see that smell to play a
prison to his mind when he goes
consult the oracle meets boy
with Buddhist costumes who can play
spoon without touching them
the boy that should not bend the spoon
it will not be possible
instead just try to realize the
true question that it is true that
there is no needle is not welcome
There the boy responds then you see
it is not the spoon that bends only
you seem to matrix the truth is that
everything is him even a very brief form
is the depreciation and unanimism
death sense the absence of
response to the purpose CUC trilogy
matrix without doubt one of the largest
movies right
It may not be the best but it is among
they certainly obviously has
flaws and holes happen yet
once that my mother has a
depth gante but steps aside
when we got the depth of
things are presented to us in
plot of the three films only philosophy
reference for example the story with
certainly one of the best and the fact
it is complex is just smart
general understanding already getting hard
many people do not really understand
first film leaving aside
other two but it is only good in my
view the first film will always be
but others also deserve better
congratulations
good guys and the moçada hope
I hope you have enjoyed tanned
more videos volume in the same style
You are always looking for films
were that were difficult
general understanding
We seek with intelligent plots and
complex to be able to explore more and
choose your fans that were difficult
go out to the general understanding beauty
then this is it even worth talked
hug and goodbye
I now come foo show me this is a
sparring program similar to the
programmed reality of the matrix it has
the same basic rules rules like gravity
what you must learn is that these rules
are no different than the rules of a
computer system some of them can be bent
others can be broken understand then hit

a Hollywood blockbuster represents
thousands of hours of work which means
that no matter how great the finished
product some pretty interesting stuff
happens behind the scenes of most films
that we the public never get to hear
about except on super cool YouTube
videos like this one here's a look at
the filming of The Matrix franchise and
some of the crazy things that happened
when the cameras weren't rolling
required reading matrix star Keanu
Reeves had to read a thousand pages
worth of philosophy and evolutionary
psychology before he was even allowed to
see the complete script for the film but
everyone in the cast had a homework
assignment to read a dense book of
French postmodern philosophy called
simulacra and simulation by Jean
Baudrillard that's because the film's
directors the Wachowski z-- wanted to be
sure that everyone in the movie really
understood the concept behind the matrix
and could explain it when asked
unlike Morpheus who clearly didn't do
the reading unfortunately no one can be
told what the matrix is you have to see
it for yourself the scene Warner
Brothers didn't want you to see the
matrix special effects team studied
everything from the physics of fluid
dynamics to the exploding patterns of
different types of glass in order to
create this awe-inspiring helicopter
crash
but the whole thing almost didn't happen
just researching the scene took so much
time money and work that Warner Brothers
tried to have it cut from the movie
entirely
fortunately the Wachowski is passion one
out in the helicopter crash stayed in
using just about every kind of special
effect available at the time the matrix
was a comic before it was a movie before
they blew your mind with this breakout
sci-fi hit directing duo the Wachowski
's had only one other successful film to
their name the lesbian crime drama bound
so to convince Warner Brothers to fund
the matrix they got comic artists Geof
Darrow and Steve's gross to turn the
script into a shot-for-shot storyboard
of the entire film the 600 page
storyboard was impressive enough to get
the studio to take the red pill giving
the Wachowskis a 60 million dollar
budget to make their vision a reality
Warner Brothers only stipulation that
they got to pick the film's star though
their choice of Keanu Reeves wasn't
initially a big hit with the Wachowskis
turns out they just didn't know Reeves
had a skill set that went way beyond
what they'd seen in Bill &amp; Ted's
Excellent Adventure all the white shirts
were actually green if you noticed that
every scene set inside the matrix
simulation is kind of green and queasy
looking you're not imagining things it
was a visual trick used by the
filmmakers to give the world a sterile
artificial feel which sure they could
have accomplished with a filter in
post-production but costume designer Kim
Barrett went the extra mile and put
every light colored piece of clothing
worn by the cast through a green wash
that also goes extra nicely with the
color scheme in the oracles kitchen
The Matrix took its casting director to
some interesting places for neo this
training simulation was designed to
teach him to keep an eye out for the
movie's evil agents but if you take
Morpheus as advice you'll notice
something weird some of the people in
this crowd look exactly alike for the
filmmakers it was a subtle hint that
whoever made this simulation took
shortcuts copying and pasting the same
code multiple different times but for
casting director Tim little it was a
challenge because he was the one who had
to scour the entire country of Australia
for dozens of pale skinned twins and
triplets to use in the scene that wasn't
the best part of the job however little
actually had the most fun visiting local
fetish clubs to find extras who would be
comfortable in
some of the films more extreme costume
options the matrix recycles back in the
day the sets constructed for the Matrix
Reloaded and the Matrix Revolutions were
among the most ambitious ever built like
the one and a half mile stretch of fake
highway that was built from scratch for
this chase scene but it didn't go to
waste
97.5 percent of the materials used in
the final two Matrix movies were either
recycled or repurposed to build
low-income housing in Mexico which means
that someone is probably sitting in a
living room right now where the very
walls are imbued with molecules of Keanu
Reeves kung-fu sweat Hugo Weaving
epiphany one of the best parts of the
Matrix Reloaded is the burly brawl where
Neel battles an army of clones of the
evil agent Smith this scene was
partially accomplished through CGI but
it was mostly done by making up a herd
of stuntmen to look just like actor Hugo
Weaving
and unfortunately this awesome movie
moment shattered any illusions weaving
had about his receding hairline talk
about a bad way to find out that you're
going bald Keanu Reeves gave away a lot
of matrix money despite what you may
have heard Keanu Reeves didn't donate
his entire salary to the movie special
effects crew but he did sign away his
residual payments forever in order to
funnel money back into the trilogy's
production nobody knows exactly how much
money Reeves passed up in order to give
the crew another two movies worth of job
security but it would have been in the
millions we'll give you a second to let
that sink in
he's the one

I've been waiting for you these films
mixed cyberpunk philosophy and religion
with sci-fi revolutionary special
effects and guns lots of guns oh shit
welcome to watchmojo.com and today we're
counting down our picks for the top 10
moments from the Matrix trilogy all did
you defeat and bothered another set of
critical now to create democracies like
wiping your ass with when this franchise
started in 1999 it took the world by
storm and influenced action and
science-fiction movies for years to come
for this list we're looking at those
moments that left us breathless
speechless amazed or any other positive
adjectives you can think of if she has
so she can every one of us also we're
only looking at the three major releases
for this list so moments from the
Animatrix or the video games have been
excluded stop teasing me this would also
be a good time to issue a spoiler alert
so here goes spoiler alert with all that
said let's take the red pill and get to
it all I'm offering is the truth nothing
number ten I think we're gonna handle
one little girl the opening the matrix
kicking off our list is also the moment
that kicked off the whole franchise in
which Trinity is on the run from both
cops and agents this scene is memorable
because it introduces the audience to
many aspects that would make the matrix
famous including the stop time kick to
the cop for running on the walls and
Trinity and the agent jumping across an
impossibly large gap between two
buildings
as the cop says possible we think so too
but as it stands so far in the film we
haven't seen anything yet
number nine the battle for Zion the
Matrix Revolutions we all knew this
battle was coming and we were not
disappointed in the third and final
matrix installment when the machines get
word of where the remaining humans of
the real world are hiding out they
attack
but the humans are ready with a little
help from their giant mech suits what
follows is a battle of epic proportions
with sentinels falling to the ground
humans getting killed and lots of blood
and carnage the dingy setting of Zion
helps add to the dreary mood of the
battle and the battle itself is one we
will not forget anytime soon number
eight neo meets the Oracle the matrix
very smash boom after finding out the
truth about bending spoons neo meets the
Oracle in this charming scene to
discover what his future holds and to
find out whether or not he is the fabled
one not quite but you were expected
right
unfortunately for him the news is not so
great you already know what I'm going to
tell you I'm not the one sorry kid the
moment is unforgettable
due to the cozy atmosphere of the
Oracles kitchen and how starkly it
contrasts with the news that Neil is not
the one and that either he or Morpheus
will die one it was going to die
which one will be up to you
Gloria foster plays the role to
perfection with her soothing voice and
grandmotherly persona as evidenced by
her freshly baked goods and the children
she keeps in her apartment I'm sorry
kiddo I really have you have a good soul
and I hate giving good people bad number
seven the final showdown
The Matrix Revolutions me I'll promise
Smith that it would end tonight and boy
did he deliver in this final fight neo
and the agent battle for control of the
matrix and the free world and what a
battle it is filled with epic moments
and extravagant displays of action this
scene definitely meets expectations the
fight has it all from martial arts
combat at the beginning to a Superman
style err fight and even mass
destruction in the form of the crater in
the road
it's a special-effects extravaganza and
one that ends the action part of the
series on a high and who can forget
those Hugo Weaving 'he's all those Hugo
Weaving
number 6 I don't come for the matrix
show me in this scene
neo has just recently been programmed
with the knowledge of kung-fu and mentor
Morpheus wants to test him what you must
learn is that these rules are no
different than the rules of a computer
system some of them can be bent the
Eastern style of fighting proved to be
hugely influential to Hollywood in
subsequent action films including the
sequel in which neophytes Sarah
featuring terrific stunts such as
Morpheus jumping and possibly high into
the air
neo running up the beam and ending with
neo moving equally and impossibly fast
the twosomes time in the dojo doesn't
only work as a teaser for things to come
but is also a great scene by itself
trying to free your mind neo but I can
only show you the door
you're the one that has to walk through
it number five the subway fight the
matrix what is he doing he's beginning
to believe this is when we really see
neo coming into his own when confronted
by Agent Smith neo doesn't run instead
he turns to face him in battle and
begins to realize his true potential
it's a stunning moment but what follows
is even better enjoy the fight is
probably the most brutal in the series
with Smith punching through concrete and
making neo spit up blood the brutality
of the scene coupled with some amazing
choreography and the famous slow-motion
gun battle in midair make the subway
battle an absolute must for this list
empty number four the freeway chase the
Matrix Reloaded you always told me to
stay off the freeway
that's true terrible suicide when let us
hope
that I was wrong
when Morpheus group rescues the
key-maker
they must make a hasty retreat and they
do it in the only way the filmmakers
behind the matrix know how featuring
some stunning scenes like Trinity riding
down the freeway in the wrong direction
and Morpheus is fight atop a moving
truck this Chase has violence slow
motion and explosions galore this scene
was so intricate that the producers
built a one and a half mile freeway on
an old decommissioned runway to allow
them to shoot everything to their
imaginations content and give us one
hell of an action scene in the process
number three the lobby shootout the
matrix in what would become one of the
most famous and parodied shootouts in
cinema neo and Trinity begin their quest
to save Morpheus from the agents
in the lobby of the building they have a
shootout with security guards and SWAT
and the result is mesmerizing with
state-of-the-art camera work we watch as
the parachutes in slow motion does
cartwheels while shooting and runs up
walls to dodge being shot at
it was unlike anything seen in an action
movie before and became wildly popular
and influential oh and by the way except
for the removing of the wire work no CGI
was used in the filming of the scene
impressive much we think so number 2 neo
becomes the one the matrix in this
striking scene neo rises from the dead
and becomes the prophesized one able to
free the humans and defeat the machines
once and for all
what makes this moment work so well is a
combination of many aspects including
Trinity's declaration of love
the swelling music and the breathtaking
sight of neo stopping the bullets in
their tracks simply by raising his hand
the fact that he goes on to defeat Smith
one-handed is just icing on the cake
it's a beautiful ending and beginning
all-in-one before we unveil our top pick
here are a few honorable mentions
who are you I am the architect I created
the matrix
the great Morpheus we meet upon us - did
you are a Smith number one bullet time
the matrix I am Emma destroyed I yes
this is truly the series most defining
moment when confronted with an agent neo
tries what he can and ends up dodging
bullets
the scene is famous for the 360 degree
camera work the slow motion sound
effects and Neil's move itself creating
one of the most memorable scenes in
cinema when audiences saw this in 1999
they saw the future of the entertainment
industry as the scene was endlessly
copied and parodied thereafter further
cementing its Worth and influence in
movie history forever
there was certainly no dodging this
always soon
dodge this do you agree with our list
what matrix moment do you think was the
best for more action-packed top 10s

it may take a very long time to figure
out exactly how much influence hackers
had in the 2016 election not to mention
who was calling the shots in fact we may
never know the complete story especially
when things like this happen
a computer server at the center of a
lawsuit against Georgia election
officials has been found wiped clean it
could have revealed whether recent
elections were compromised by hackers it
is not clear who ordered the servers
data to be erased in July the FBI is not
commenting about the case come on I have
double backups of my 3,000 cat pictures
can you not give the same attention to
democracy oh here's me with more the
Department of Homeland Security
contacted election officials in 21
states to notify them that they had been
targeted by Russian government hackers
during the 2016 campaign but could
foreign agents really be seeking to sow
seeds of doubt in the integrity of our
electoral process and if the answer is
yes
i sat down with cybersecurity researcher
Logan Lam to find out just how worried I
should be are you trying to make this a
matrix parody
I'm the neo your eternity I think I'm
Morpheus right now no that's I don't
remember the character names it's not
important shut up I needed answers
answers that could affect the future of
America's democracy I take the blue pill
I wake up tomorrow and believe whatever
I want to believe or I take the red pill
and you can show me how deep the
rabbit-hole goes
oh yeah yeah I don't think you're
supposed to do that I think something's
supposed to happen now
production hit me with the truth Geek
Squad why should I be worried about our
nation's election integrity because a
lot of the machines that are being used
today and our elections have been known
to be vulnerable for the past 10 plus
years so are you saying that the
machines we use to vote are insecure
hilariously so maybe the machines are
insecure because people like you are
always criticizing them did you remember
that well I have facts and well
published research from experts that
don't work anymore try again I hacked
into a voting machine in the state of
Georgia oh my fucking god all of the
voting machines in the state of Georgia
are managed by the Center for election
systems at Kennesaw State I did a quick
little google search and I ran across a
really weird link at that point I wrote
a little bit of code to download
everything that I could from that
website
there were PDFs of Election Day
passwords that supervisors used to start
an in elections can you tell me what the
password was 4 digit PIN I have to put
in 16 letters and digits to get into my
Fresh Direct account kidding me but it
gets worse great there were voter
registration databases which had full
names date of births addresses so a
hacker could log in to the online voter
registration and change people's
information
changing the registration for citizens
so they are unable to vote is probably
the worst case scenario you're basically
saying that we can't trust the machines
we absolutely can't trust the machines
good thing there are only two hundred
and twenty nine thousand of these things
currently being used in the United
States mm-hmm
the issue with electronic voting
machines is that you can't easily verify
your personal vote
there's no way to audit the results so
all that's standing between Russia and
our democracy is a Zune for Microsoft
sorry I'm nerd wrote that joke
hold on Pat what's a zoo what's a zoo
yeah it's like an mp3 player from a
couple of years ago this matrix parody
that I thought was gonna be so fun is
just so depressing but there is a
solution okay well who should I talk to
the Donna's I should speak to the
Donna's
yes the dollars I was told you two were
my Oracle I'm Donna and I'm Donna this
is a glitch in the matrix how am I
supposed to tell you two apart we look
different this is Donna curling and
Donna price they're pro-democracy
activists from Georgia who have been
fighting the machine since it was a good
time to parody the matrix we are
fighting to have voters vote on paper
ballots instead of voting by electronic
machine where their votes can be
disappeared this is the solution from
stopping the machines from taking over a
ruining democracy is paper and pencil
paper and pencil this voter verified
paper ballots what does that mean to
people who like don't care it's when
they have a ballot that they mark and
they can look to see that their marks
are by the candidates that they're
picking you ever tried to rephrase the
issue to be something like electronic
voting is like taking me that will get
people excited yes but we need your help
to get the word out
oh you mean I am the one
I guess this is a lot of pressure but
it's well worth it to stop anonymous or
Russia or whoever's in the machine for
hacking into our elections oh shit
who makes a trickster all these in 2017
ha ha ha come at me bro you sick bastard
saving democracy is gonna be harder than
I thought
oh that was easy hello America listen
there is no evidence that a foreign
power has hacked our votes but we need
to focus Oh sandwich because they could
and maybe they will
aunt ain't because I've just explained
how easy it is to get into the voting
machines and until we return to paper
ballots our democracy is at risk of
being totally screwed don't do it didn't
win the matrix we'll be right back
[Applause]
