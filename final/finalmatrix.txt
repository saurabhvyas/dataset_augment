I've been waiting for you these films
mixed cyberpunk philosophy and religion
with sci-fi revolutionary special
effects and guns lots of guns oh shit
welcome to watchmojo.com and today we're
counting down our picks for the top 10
moments from the Matrix trilogy all did
you defeat and bothered another set of
critical now to create democracies like
wiping your ass with when this franchise
started in 1999 it took the world by
storm and influenced action and
science-fiction movies for years to come
for this list we're looking at those
moments that left us breathless
speechless amazed or any other positive
adjectives you can think of if she has
so she can every one of us also we're
only looking at the three major releases
for this list so moments from the
Animatrix or the video games have been
excluded stop teasing me this would also
be a good time to issue a spoiler alert
so here goes spoiler alert with all that
said let's take the red pill and get to
it all I'm offering is the truth nothing
number ten I think we're gonna handle
one little girl the opening the matrix
kicking off our list is also the moment
that kicked off the whole franchise in
which Trinity is on the run from both
cops and agents this scene is memorable
because it introduces the audience to
many aspects that would make the matrix
famous including the stop time kick to
the cop for running on the walls and
Trinity and the agent jumping across an
impossibly large gap between two
buildings
as the cop says possible we think so too
but as it stands so far in the film we
haven't seen anything yet
number nine the battle for Zion the
Matrix Revolutions we all knew this
battle was coming and we were not
disappointed in the third and final
matrix installment when the machines get
word of where the remaining humans of
the real world are hiding out they
attack
but the humans are ready with a little
help from their giant mech suits what
follows is a battle of epic proportions
with sentinels falling to the ground
humans getting killed and lots of blood
and carnage the dingy setting of Zion
helps add to the dreary mood of the
battle and the battle itself is one we
will not forget anytime soon number
eight neo meets the Oracle the matrix
very smash boom after finding out the
truth about bending spoons neo meets the
Oracle in this charming scene to
discover what his future holds and to
find out whether or not he is the fabled
one not quite but you were expected
right
unfortunately for him the news is not so
great you already know what I'm going to
tell you I'm not the one sorry kid the
moment is unforgettable
due to the cozy atmosphere of the
Oracles kitchen and how starkly it
contrasts with the news that Neil is not
the one and that either he or Morpheus
will die one it was going to die
which one will be up to you
Gloria foster plays the role to
perfection with her soothing voice and
grandmotherly persona as evidenced by
her freshly baked goods and the children
she keeps in her apartment I'm sorry
kiddo I really have you have a good soul
and I hate giving good people bad number
seven the final showdown
The Matrix Revolutions me I'll promise
Smith that it would end tonight and boy
did he deliver in this final fight neo
and the agent battle for control of the
matrix and the free world and what a
battle it is filled with epic moments
and extravagant displays of action this
scene definitely meets expectations the
fight has it all from martial arts
combat at the beginning to a Superman
style err fight and even mass
destruction in the form of the crater in
the road
it's a special-effects extravaganza and
one that ends the action part of the
series on a high and who can forget
those Hugo Weaving 'he's all those Hugo
Weaving
number 6 I don't come for the matrix
show me in this scene
neo has just recently been programmed
with the knowledge of kung-fu and mentor
Morpheus wants to test him what you must
learn is that these rules are no
different than the rules of a computer
system some of them can be bent the
Eastern style of fighting proved to be
hugely influential to Hollywood in
subsequent action films including the
sequel in which neophytes Sarah
featuring terrific stunts such as
Morpheus jumping and possibly high into
the air
neo running up the beam and ending with
neo moving equally and impossibly fast
the twosomes time in the dojo doesn't
only work as a teaser for things to come
but is also a great scene by itself
trying to free your mind neo but I can
only show you the door
you're the one that has to walk through
it number five the subway fight the
matrix what is he doing he's beginning
to believe this is when we really see
neo coming into his own when confronted
by Agent Smith neo doesn't run instead
he turns to face him in battle and
begins to realize his true potential
it's a stunning moment but what follows
is even better enjoy the fight is
probably the most brutal in the series
with Smith punching through concrete and
making neo spit up blood the brutality
of the scene coupled with some amazing
choreography and the famous slow-motion
gun battle in midair make the subway
battle an absolute must for this list
empty number four the freeway chase the
Matrix Reloaded you always told me to
stay off the freeway
that's true terrible suicide when let us
hope
that I was wrong
when Morpheus group rescues the
key-maker
they must make a hasty retreat and they
do it in the only way the filmmakers
behind the matrix know how featuring
some stunning scenes like Trinity riding
down the freeway in the wrong direction
and Morpheus is fight atop a moving
truck this Chase has violence slow
motion and explosions galore this scene
was so intricate that the producers
built a one and a half mile freeway on
an old decommissioned runway to allow
them to shoot everything to their
imaginations content and give us one
hell of an action scene in the process
number three the lobby shootout the
matrix in what would become one of the
most famous and parodied shootouts in
cinema neo and Trinity begin their quest
to save Morpheus from the agents
in the lobby of the building they have a
shootout with security guards and SWAT
and the result is mesmerizing with
state-of-the-art camera work we watch as
the parachutes in slow motion does
cartwheels while shooting and runs up
walls to dodge being shot at
it was unlike anything seen in an action
movie before and became wildly popular
and influential oh and by the way except
for the removing of the wire work no CGI
was used in the filming of the scene
impressive much we think so number 2 neo
becomes the one the matrix in this
striking scene neo rises from the dead
and becomes the prophesized one able to
free the humans and defeat the machines
once and for all
what makes this moment work so well is a
combination of many aspects including
Trinity's declaration of love
the swelling music and the breathtaking
sight of neo stopping the bullets in
their tracks simply by raising his hand
the fact that he goes on to defeat Smith
one-handed is just icing on the cake
it's a beautiful ending and beginning
all-in-one before we unveil our top pick
here are a few honorable mentions
who are you I am the architect I created
the matrix
the great Morpheus we meet upon us - did
you are a Smith number one bullet time
the matrix I am Emma destroyed I yes
this is truly the series most defining
moment when confronted with an agent neo
tries what he can and ends up dodging
bullets
the scene is famous for the 360 degree
camera work the slow motion sound
effects and Neil's move itself creating
one of the most memorable scenes in
cinema when audiences saw this in 1999
they saw the future of the entertainment
industry as the scene was endlessly
copied and parodied thereafter further
cementing its Worth and influence in
movie history forever
there was certainly no dodging this
always soon
dodge this do you agree with our list
what matrix moment do you think was the
best for more action-packed top 10s

you
a
a
good morning and welcome to my world
unknown point is already discussed in
Sometimes the matrix
Maybe if you are the first time
I heard about it
I wonder what is the Matrix
this video
We will explain that the matrix is a
mind and what happens inside
but before saying it is a mind
let's tell where it comes from this
idea
you will see everything around us
the monitor that you have in front of such
Once the smartphone or possibly
tablet is not real does not exist as such
They are simply frequencies
electromagnetic vibrating more or
less intensity you through
the senses can perceive their
these senses are delivered
our laboratory perceptions
It is in our brain and we believe and
We settle everything around us
we think there is this marker that
my hand and we think there
But what I can feel and smell touch
solely because
I created this matrix receiving all
the data generated by this marker and
ebro analyzing comics is not
Real is an electromagnetic frequency
vibrating at a different rate at
which can deliver a radio frequency
or frequency that vibrates
Example waves and microwaves is not
tangible
we simply found in his
same width or the same frequency and
They are able to touch what are the
as often as we are
within our matrix we see the
sevenths we take it and we all
what we do seem real without
But it is not
it speaks go to the old
cultures in one way or another they were
explaining what the ancient Hindus
They defined as the Maya so called
that universe created and generated by a
mind and said that the real
universe was behind the truth
It was called brack ma
It is very difficult to explain this concept
If you do not understand everything
we have around us is not what
It seems to be to control and
dominate the mesh to control and
master matrix is important that
you understand that is linked to
each and every one of the objects
exist
all you have in front of your wall
your keyboard
perhaps the chair is part of a whole
we create the idea that we are
separate each person and each
group is a kind of unit when
Actually everything is kind of block
living within a simulation
immense which it is created by a mind
these concepts may be
difficult to understand you but you
I will give an example very clear if you
You want to create this pen and has
no plastic material has
ink and has no money to
buy as believes area
with your mind you can create anything
with your mind , in your imagination
You can have a pen like
we create with our minds one
mind above us has
created a mind from which we will
talk
we are part of a thought and that
mind has to turn over and over by
and above this world or those worlds
we develop our imagination
they turn others and others
the matrix is a mind that thinks we
we create our matrix
thoughts
we form and are creators of
the matrix
but our matrix has been stolen
Unfortunately things are not
as they should be we will explain
what happened to the matrix
To understand this concept is
important that you understand
previously an example that I'm going to
I'm going to put a couple of them put
This way you will understand how is
configured the matrix
3 in the universe or in our universe
there are intelligent entities other than
We loved that we could call
located at a higher level
we and others at a lower level
To understand this concept of how
these beings function
I will say that things or issues
They are as follows Louis
First on top
we could say that they are a
beings that we call the
first order
the first order we will do as you
it was a pyramid structure these
beings first order
let's call them beings 0
There are other beings just below
we can call these beings
one level below these there are other
also intelligent beings with minds
They are able to create these beings
level 2 and below these are
other beings who can also create
They are beings Level 3
quite possibly the matrix of the universe
is much deeper up and
much deeper down but
let's focus on our reality
in what surrounds us these beings
top are the source
the original seed source mind
Primal is what creates us
first child breaks for you to understand
This concept will explain this
so when you have one in front
computer or a smartphone or a tablet
as I said earlier and that there
some icons appears the menu
maybe listening to music options Video
not magically comes out of that unit has
I had to be programmed and that
Programming has levels
at the beginning of programming
find the edge and hard work will
draw a chip that chip
say it is the support on which
the programming focus
let's talk now
this chip is programmed with binary
zeros and ones
this would be the source source code
and switches seed that
on and off
in one way or another your phone has
million your computer hundreds of thousands
of millions and so on
the next level if you at the end of
all this long history is in
your tablet with a series of icons and
graphic possibilities can you
manipulate the following has occurred
someone has created what is called the
Assembler some call flesh
assembler
subsequently to program it
the tablet or the computer has created
the low - level languages
For example we could subsequently
talk about him the c + + co or could
speak of females
or we can speak of that next
level that exists to reach these
icons are high - level languages
these high - level languages by
example basic for example there is
They are much more complex as it
low thickens
and as accused reach the
top
the instructions are much more
simple
That's what happens there is a process for
you see this is that someone has
I had to program all this can not
whether it be before there has been no
this and this if there is not this
of course it all depends on the source
of the source of the origin called
Bragman
at the end you find yourself with that
Actually you see on your tablet does not stop
analyze what is behind
the code if it works or not or
instructions behind or how
operating from within that processor not
simply you handle the tablet
opening videos or listening to music
perhaps you are sending a message
so does the mind mind
It is peculiar human is peculiar because it has
It has been growing from inside to outside
our mind works as follows
way
We've talked on occasion if
we think this is a human mind
eg
He has grown precisely in this
address
in the central part are the
basic instincts what is called the
the reptile brain later
more complex functions up to
the intelligence is in the
outermost layer in the center
basic functions occur eat
sleep drink
then more complex functions
and finally the outside of the
analytical intelligence capable of
process all that information
analyze responses and reach
conclusions
It works the same way to the same
way math works if we
We realize the two plus two is four
They have reached physical developments
simply amazing theoretical
It means two field theories
relativity all is well
the universe is how it works scale
mind our body is well
our cells are made up
This genetic DNA chain that that
also called genetic code code
curiously this code creates a
cells and these cells create organs
and those bodies created the individual
part of this society and
matrix around us
as we see the examples are repetitive
simile is constant and we see
all the issues around us
military structure social structure
the employment structure
everything works structurally as ai
Indian
There are a number of things as I said
before the call these beings
as part of the original seed
the primal mind is we know very
some of it
we have very little data from this source
Here are our creators
the mind that created us and we thought we
He created from like us
We create a marker for what happens before
it was created by our mind and
our mind creates
the tablet that you have in front was
created by the mind of someone who
designed the tablet which in turn design
another person
its software that allows you to operate
someone she designed her battery
Internal because he thought his mind and
someone discovered that he could
store energy in batteries
because he thought his mind and
developments were more and more complex
to the point where we
someone thought we find ourselves and
someone took us created source code
and design the human being was his mind
who created us in some cultures and
civilizations
They call the Demiurge
In this part we find ourselves
this is the point at which being
human is if here is the
human being
and we also believe there are beings of
another level that are created with our
mind our imagination create
thoughts create living machines
in our mind are beings
third order and part of
thoughts are created in flat
astral and dependent on us
some of them become objects
Physical others they become
objects operating in astral planes
so that our reality is forged
formerly control these beings
it was done so naturally
routinely ancients had a
secret and sacred knowledge that was
lost with the arrival of
Regionalism makes about two thousand or three
perhaps a thousand years previously
used regularly but we
to talk about this part that creates being
human
This code does things
this code we will call it by
give it a name we can understand what
call scripts their
and
which is a script is a code script
You are running a program source within
the computer world and here we go
define equal humans creates
programs that create programs scripts
Actually we have with
our mind we see
all the good and bad
We forge our destiny are creators
our reality all that
you have bad it is because the scripts
you have created in your mind you have
led in that direction
what you are good and those
great achievements it has obtained is because
scripts and programs used
I believe in this universe and this
matrix led him towards the road
speak it goes wide mallet
I had so many physical CREPAD in the kart
olé
I come to mind right now by
rhonda byrne such youth doctor
william walton Buddha
all spoke of the same in the
antiquity with ancestral rites
heathen
for example created witchcraft
third-order entities operating at
our desires for creating scripts
program codes that were used
in favor of our desires
Over time these practices
They have been limited to small circles
These scripts can be positive or
They can be negative
these codes we created this program
we create our entities
We created in other planes in other planes
lower than ours can be
positive and operate on our behalf but
They can also be negative for
example blood sacrifice
achieve power and control that
Baal was god for instance
what he did was create scripts
evil entities that used the
deceit and cunning and the
cruelty to meet his master
kept alive because their master
He kept alive in his mind and with those
rites and the delivery of blood to them
fed and gave them power and turn
these beings our evil entities
fed power or giving his master
giving that control or calling
evil acts in some cases
this type
bill such issues if
They used positively most of the
Sometimes those ancient shamans
They knew they had to use this
type of system programming
bring rain in times of
Drought had to use it to
bring wealth and prosperity in the hunt
They had to create it to scare away
They are creating enemies such entities
for protection
They knew were programs operate
They used for good and
achieve health
abundance happiness
knowledge is dual and
Using this matrix by
our mind and creating these
Ideas so is
knew all this for example if
you have had the opportunity
surely you have seen many sites
as are incomprehensible and the
part for example of a higher
knoll we are mysteriously one
come
urbaneja who put it there because it
He puts there because they are energy points
where you are scripts where they were
their rites and knew that at these points
there was a mighty power
He amplifies those ideas that created
multiplying the reality they
created were formerly as I said
menhirs dolmens they used used
even ancient obelisks hermitage
placed in inhospitable sites because
in places that energy exuded
allowing greater control of that
and magic that we have to operate
correctly
and Zarathustra said that the worst of his
days was when he discovered the power
had to create things because if
that power not used properly
it would be their own destruction
when we want evil we feel bad
and we think that everything is going wrong and goes
a failure to lose health
I'm not financially well what
They do what you do is schedule
scripts telling the universe that
It is what I want really because
I talk about it because I think about it
constantly
the universe does not understand if you tell me
I do not want only understands poverty
poverty word because it is a verb and a
we have done when we talk
use language correctly and not
We can say I do not want poverty
I have to say I want wealth for
These programs work
ancients did correctly in
these places was the most powerful
They succeeded in getting energy hunting
They getting rain abundance using
correctly their strength and magic
and
While the following video program
We talk about the next program
we devote to the matrix talk
on third - degree entities
of course part of this matris
OCCUPY reptilians called as
I always say no more of this world
unknown point is we are in the
next video program soon
hey guys and welcome back to all the
mods 3 oh yeah as the last time we set
this thing up here are these things I
guess is more accurate they've been
doing work overnight and you know they
did something they did they did work so
you see here we've got 28,000 we did
have 40,000 but I moved a bunch of it
into the the system there I still have
it going because I don't know how much
I'm gonna need I did last night set up
this here so this is making enriched
iron which is apparently a dust so this
is making enriched iron and then this
one's turning that enriched iron into
steel stuff and then that is going to
over here into pleasee there goes steel
blend it gets cooked it gets turned into
steel because we're gonna need wrap tons
of steel tons and so we're gonna build
hopefully an induction matrix today and
so you see I've got some stuff crafting
here a bunch of induction cells
induction ports induction casing oh my
god so much stuff so much freaking stuff
oh my god
steel I ended up with just over 8,000 I
was using this - we've used a ton of
coal I also have coal going through this
to get pulverized turned into pulverized
coal so that we can we can do this and
so if we look in here coal and then I
just been like transferring this out and
into here and then it gets pulled in and
it makes steel
so yeah it's it's it's uh it's it's
quite expensive it's very very expensive
and we're gonna put it in the mining
world we're gonna put it we're gonna
have both the the the solar thing and
the big reactor the bigger extreme
reactor because this one's not actually
hooked up to anything anymore
there's no power drain on this
whatsoever why is it full
anyway yeah so yeah there's no drain on
that guy anymore okay I think I'm gonna
turn off this make this cold stop though
I think what we have going down below is
enough for now and then that's got a
bunch of gold it's got a cut or
pulverize
so yeah that's that is the plan to make
that induction thingy I just got to wait
for all of this to quit and this is all
this is just basic this is the basic
basic basic stuff we can actually look
let's go let's look at the ultimate
induction provider let's look at one
what does it take to craft one so you
see there's 304 of the basic control
circuits sixty-eight reinforced alloys
eighty one storage tablets 486 enriched
alloys some refined obsidian 399 osmium
640 iron 200 steel 200 glass it is very
expensive oh my god expensive like like
oh my god expensive and that's just the
the induction provider the the other
thing is the ultimate induction cell and
that's pretty freakin ridiculous as well
that's even more expensive so I think
starting off with a basic hopefully we
can get something with some decent
storage as long as it's more than like
these guys are holding because I think
if it's not we may just go with these
because we can chain these together you
know have them you know just build a
multi-block type thing with these and
just have them feed you know into each
other by I really want to try the
induction matrix because I've never done
it before so I'm hoping it's something
we will be able to do as far as crystals
overnight we've got the wall to this
point I've been on for a couple hours
we've got 333 iein ight and then a bunch
more of this other stuff so we're
getting that pretty good I wanna I kind
of want to get up over 500 of this
before I decide to cuz I think I'm gonna
upgrade the solar before I upgrade the
minor maybe maybe I think that's the
better way to go about it and then like
we didn't even have like the recipe for
that in there but yeah like I said I
gotta wait for all of this to finish so
I mean it's getting close it's getting
there we've only got one hundred and
eighty four more induction I'm making
more induction casings that I need
because I don't know how many I'm gonna
need and the entire thing has to be
wrapped in the induction casing so I'm
gonna let this finish and then once
we're ready to set this whole thing up
I shall return all right so here we go
everything finally finished crafting so
I think what we're gonna do is we're
going to tear out all of this here
that's under this waste my magnet off
we're not--we're alright so we're gonna
tear this out gives to me the thing
because I want to build this thing like
right under this right I think that's
the best way to do it okay
so I think and see how we gotta do this
induction port will go here right and
then we got to the induction provider so
apparently the induction the induction
ports have to touch an induction
provider right so let's see do we have
enough to do that so if we can do that
so that that will be in this will be out
right
and that we have these induction cells
these are what makes or determines how
much power it can hold I believe and I
don't know I mean I may have to make
some more of these but and I'm pretty
sure it could be like any size up to
[Music]
eighteen by eighteen by eighteen that's
quite a bit all right so if we had one
more of actually you know what what we
can do is we can add another induction
provider and then wrap that with the
induction cells right so we do that and
then we got to put this there and then
this goes everywhere else right and then
do that will come up around the sides
and then we'll after this we'll just use
the building wand to kind of speed it
along all right and there and then Sun
up come on let me in there let me thank
you all all right we got that that yeah
all right so what is the storage on this
guy 40 weight 40 Giga joules I don't
know what that is so the input output is
isn't there a way to see like the ha
stands 320 Kate
Jules I guess pudding okay so
wait I thought I had three wait crap
that can't be there because we gotta get
the input from that as well right and
right there it's blocked mmm so this
whole thing has to come down one sanam
all right so I think we've made it
somewhere yeah
all right so see how we gonna do this I
really wanted the output from that to
come straight into it but I think we're
gonna have to get some quantum type
things online I don't think we have this
lag though yeah I think we're gonna have
to put a quantum thing there just to get
it to here I mean we could have made it
one time mmm you know all this and I
could have just made another induction
port because you need induction ports
for input and output I could have just
left it how it was made another
induction port for that which I think I
think what I'm gonna do so what I ended
up doing is you see these guys are
actually read these induction providers
it was only doing like 40-some thousand
out and this alone would blow that out
of the water and so I needed something
that would be better right and so I
think what we're gonna actually have to
do is do that and then we're gonna need
some more these induction cells eight is
seven lower seven more induction cells
and then this will have to go right so
that left that one spot open all right
so yeah we need seven more induction
cells
and then another induction provider or
well no what does it call conducts
important induction port and then that
will yeah and then we'll have the input
from that straight into it and then the
input from that here and then I think
we're gonna see if we can't send it up
to where I don't know if a comparator
will work on this or maybe there's like
an energy the energy like something that
like unfortunate yeah what we need
something that can determine how much
energy is inside and out put a redstone
signal because the way I want it to work
is I want this thing to mostly be
running off of this and then if it gets
below a certain percentage I want that
to kick on and say hey here's some more
power because between the two this does
106,000 RF per tick and that does I
think it was like 67,000 RF per tick
that I mean that's 170,000 hours per
tick right so that's 170 thousand plus
whatever that should be pretty good for
now I mean we're definitely not using
that so yeah okay so we need wait what
was it seven more and the pieces in here
don't apparently have to like match tear
so we could just fill it up with basics
and then just use this for the advanced
stuff for making it input/output faster
because the basic and the basic ones
they do like 8 K each I think and those
ones do 64 K each or something and
depending on how many of those you have
inside the case is is what determines
the D in out all right so let's see what
it's gonna take
to make we needed what eight more basic
induction sells it sells eight more
basic induction sells that that will
happen and then we need one more of
these right so that one or two oh yeah
it does two at a time didn't okay oh I
told it to crap wait no I don't even
know right now okay so this should wait
you know what while we're here while
we're here let's grab a quantum crap how
do we not have one of those you know
what I think for now we've got plenty of
this stuff we're just gonna steal this
one just for the sake of sanity I guess
no that all of that over there is just
running off that there's nowhere near
enough well actually is it enough power
is it keeping this thing full nice okay
I was curious is it nice
okay do we have any back here with it I
don't think we need this one anymore I
don't think this one's going I think
this was going to the quarry but we
don't have a quarry any so oh no back
down so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna sense sorry I always stop talking
right there just because we're gonna set
the quantum guy on that too we want we
wanted a new channel let's go 9999 is
good and off checked on all inputs so
that's on energy or channel 99 let's put
this one on channel 99 this will eject
so this thing is not filling with power
yet alright let's go ahead poop those
around let's put that there and boom
perfect so that's putting power in at
64,000 RF per tick and then in if we
slept this would be putting in 108
thousand hours per tick now we need to
see if we can get something on here to
admit a redstone signal
yeah the input and input output 448 k RF
per tick it holds five point eight seven
number so it's a little bit higher then
the the the 32 million that we're
holding in the energy cells right a
little bit more just a skosh just a
skosh more all right so we've got some
stuff going on here we've gotten 170 mm
in nice very nice
we need to get power coming out I
completely forgot everything is now not
running to do that and then just do this
guy right there
and then he will be on to which was our
energy right he's our okay
- energy injects their right does it
have to be a cape is he output zero can
it wait
side config energy input all sides does
it have to be into a freakin cable are
you serious
0rf pertick do we have to configure
these maybe oh there we go okay okay
okay
much better okay - cent sign config in
off aha there we go that'll send power
to everything that needs power 99 is
that 199 is that one and that one is
going into there
generating all the powered can and this
will hopefully fill up at some point
well yeah I mean it shouldn't take too
long and then now we what we need to see
is can we get a comparator off of here
I'm gonna assume no but hopefully we can
all right so it doesn't look like it hmm
and there's
thin yeah this thing doesn't even
respond to redstone control hmm wow
that's oh that's the output okay okay we
don't know what is going on there all
right so I guess we should hook this
thing back up let's get rid of all this
and I think we're just gonna pipe this
directly into the ender chest that we
apparently no longer have oh wait there
it is never mind never mind let's get
rid of all this and we will slap this
guy right there all right so that is on
to energy on it reject and there we go
and so now it is definitely definitely
definitely running full power definitely
full speed full power full bore full
full out ahead and this thing is it is
gaining power right yes good oh yeah we
can look at the input/output so we're
using 20k we're producing a hundred and
seventy 2k nice all right now the
question is let's take a look here hold
on now we're using 2k this thing uses
18k holy crap
that's insane I think uses eighteen krf
per tick that's nuts
okay and it doesn't look like this is
gonna work so I mean eventually that
will get full I was really hoping to
kind of run off that as much as possible
and then only kick this on when it was
like absolutely needed you know this
thing is like constantly
yeah it's constantly trained constantly
making power
yeah that's what I was hoping I mean
there's probably a way to do it I'm just
I'm drawing a blank right now and then
once we upgrade this thing like the tier
5 is gonna go I'm gonna assume like 200
some thousand RF per tick and then for
tier 6 I think we're gonna actually have
to upgrade this thing because I think I
think the tier 6 is 512 K if I'm not
mistaken so yeah we're doing really what
that is a lot of power storage and I
mean that's not actually all that big I
mean it's kind of ugly I mean I think it
could look better but I mean as long as
it works right right and it is
definitely working powers doing things
and stuff and whatnot oh we got all the
power bang it's all good all right guys
I think that's gonna do it for today
hopefully enjoyed the episode and I will
see you all next time
I now come foo show me this is a
sparring program similar to the
programmed reality of the matrix it has
the same basic rules rules like gravity
what you must learn is that these rules
are no different than the rules of a
computer system some of them can be bent
others can be broken understand then hit
me if you can
good adaptation improvisation which your
weakness is not your technique for this

how did I beat you it's you fast do you
believe that my being stronger or faster
has anything to do with my muscles in
this place you think that's air you're
breathing now
again Jesus Christ is fast
take a look these neural kinetics their

what are you waiting for
you're faster than this don't think you
up no you are
come on stop trying to hit me and hit me
believe it I know what you're trying to
do
I know what it does is weekends
You've seen all the movies martel
and again you get a marathon is
It is really amazing not stop
quiet judge you not seen up to ten
iron man 3 times and can not stand
I know what you're talking about
You've seen it all a thousand times but there
something that does not fit have made a
PhD geek universe
Marvel Cinematic but something
not yet understand you observed
Toru vault audouin not

incomplete
You know I'm talking and finity
war
exact
day after day twitter look to see if
There hung the trailer for Infinity World
if there is a rumor that give you
hopes but never find
answers
I can help neo
how you would like to see the trailer for the
avengers infinity world view before
no one
be the first Naco infiltrate clear
You will have to decide your own fate
neo if you take the blue pill
You wake up in your bed next to a
supermodel will have much more money
but now you've seen the

so now we're going to find the inverse
of a 3x3 matrix so here we have a 3x3
matrix a and the first thing we're going
to do is find the determinant of this
matrix a and the way I like to find the
determinant is just by copying the first
two columns and placing them on the
right side of the matrix so we'll start
with this first column right here I'm
going to copy it and place it to the
right of the matrix so notice how I copy
the numbers 1 0 5 and I placed them to
the right side of the matrix and now I'm
going to do the same exact thing with
the column 2 I'm going to copy it and
place it to the right side of the matrix
now by copying these two columns
notice how I'm able to create three
diagonals I have one diagonal right here
I have another diagonal right here and I
have another diagonal right here what we
need to do is we need to multiply the
numbers in all three diagonals so that's
what I'm going to do right now in this
first diagonal we have 1 1 and 0 so I'm
going to multiply all those numbers
together 1 times 1 is just 1 1 times 0
is 0 and in the second diagonal we have
2 times 5 which is 10 and 10 times 5
which is 50 and in the third diagonal we
have 3 times 0 which is 0 0 times 6 is
also 0 and after we multiply these
diagonals we need to do the exact same
thing with the diagonals going the
opposite way so notice how we have three
diagonals going the opposite way we have
one right here we have one right here
and we have one right here and if we
multiply these diagonals together
starting with the first one we have 5
times 1 which is 5 5 times 3 is 15 in
the second diagonally we have 6 times 5
which is 30 30 times 1 is also 30 and in
the third diagonal we have 0 times 0
which is 0 0 times 2 is also 0 so now to
find the determinant of matrix a the
only thing that we need to do is take
the
red numbers and add them together and
then subtract them from all the green
numbers so with our red numbers we have
a zero eight positive 50 and another
zero and we need to subtract the red
numbers from the green numbers and the
green numbers are positive 15 positive
30 and zero so the determinant of matrix
a is equal to zero plus 50 plus 0 which
is just 50 minus 15 plus 30 which is 45
50 minus 45 is just equal to 5 so the
determinant of matrix a is equal to 5 so
after we find our determinant we have to
find what I like to call a new matrix so
let's just call our new matrix n so how
do we know what goes inside of our new
matrix n so let's take a look at our
original matrix a let's take a look at
the number in the top left position this
number 1 if we cross out the row and the
column of this number 1 notice how we're
left with a 2 by 2 matrix 1 5 6 0 so in
the top left position we need to copy
that 2 by 2 matrix and put 1 5 6 0 so
now we need to do the same exact thing
for every number in the matrix a so now
we'll move on to the top middle number
this number 2 if we cross out the row
and the column of this number 2 we're
left with a 2 by 2 matrix 0 5 &amp; 5 0 so
I'm going to copy that 2 by 2 matrix and
place it in the top middle position 0 5
5 0 so now let's do the same thing for
the number in the top right position
this number 3 if we cross out
row and the column of the number three
we're left with a 2 by 2 matrix 0 1 5 6
so I'm going to copy that 2 by 2 matrix
in the top right position 0 1 5 6 so now
let's do the same exact thing for the
number in the middle left position this
number 0 if we cross out the row and the
column of this number 0 we're left with
the 2 by 2 matrix 2 3 6 0 so I'm going
to copy that 2 by 2 matrix in the middle
left position 2 3 6 0 so now let's do
the same as our thing for our middle
number which is 1 I'm going to cross out
the row and the column of this number 1
and we're left with the 2 by 2 matrix 1
3 5 0 so I'm going to copy that 2 by 2
matrix in the middle 1 3 5 0 so now
let's do the same thing for the number
in the middle right position this number
5 if we cross out the column and the row
of this number 5 we're left with the 2x2
matrix 1 2 5 6 so I'm going to copy that
2x2 matrix into our middle right
position 1 2 5 6 now if we do the same
thing for the number in the bottom left
position this number 5 we cross out the
column and the row of this number 5
we're left with the 2x2 matrix 2 3 1 5
so I'm going to copy that 2x2 matrix in
the bottom left position 2 3 1 5 and
moving on to the number in the bottom
middle position this number 6 if we
cross out the column and the row of this
number 6 we're left with a 2 by 2 matrix
1 3 0 5 so I'm going to copy that
2 by 2 matrix in the bottom middle
position 1 3 0 5
and finally we can move on to our number
in the bottom right position this number
zero if we cross out the column and the
row of this number zero we're left with
a two by two matrix 1 2 0 1 so I'm going
to copy that 2 by 2 matrix in the bottom
right position 1 2 0 1 and now we have
filled our new 3x3 matrix n with a bunch
of smaller two-by-two matrices so now we
can move on to our next step
our next step is we need to replace our
new matrix n with the determinants of
all these two-by-two matrices so we'll
start with the matrix in the top left
corner to find the determinant of a 2 by
2 matrix you just need to multiply this
diagonal and then multiply this diagonal
and then subtract the both so that's
what I'm going to do right now we have 1
times 0 which is 0 and we have 5 times 6
which is 30 0 minus 30 is equal to
negative 30 now we'll move on to the top
middle matrix we have 0 times 0 which is
0 and 5 times 5 which is 25 0 minus 25
is negative 25 now we'll move on to the
top right corner we have 0 times 6 which
is 0 and 5 times 1 which is 5 0 minus 5
is equal to negative 5 now moving on to
the middle left we have 2 times 0 which
is 0 and 3 times 6 which is 18 0 minus
18 is negative 18 moving on to the
middle matrix we have 1 times 0 which is
0 3 times 5 which is 15 0 minus 15 is
negative 15 moving on to the
middle-right matrix we have 1 times 6
which is 6 and 2 times 5 which is 10 6
minus 10 is equal to negative 4 moving
on to the bottom left matrix we have 2
times 5 which is equal to 10 we have 3
times 1 which is 3 10 minus 3 is equal
to positive 7
when we go into the bottom middle matrix
we have 1 times 5 which is 5 3 times 0
which is 0 5 minus 0 is equal to
positive 5 and moving on to the bottom
right we have 1 times 1 which is equal
to 1 and 2 times 0 which is equal to 0 1
minus 0 is equal to positive 1 so now we
have replaced our matrix n with the
determinants of all these 2 by 2
matrices so moving on to our next step
we need to alternate positive and
negative signs in our matrix so if we
start in the top left position we'll
start with a positive sign then we got
to alternate to a negative positive
negative positive negative positive
negative and positive so now I'm going
to scroll down just a bit just to give
myself a little bit more space so now if
we simplify our matrix n we have a
positive and a negative 30 the positive
and negative gives us a negative number
we have a negative negative 25 two
negatives gives us a positive 25 we have
a positive negative 5 so that just stays
negative 5 we have a negative negative
18 two negatives gives us a positive 18
we have a positive negative 15 so that
just stays as a negative 15 we have a
negative negative 4 two negatives gives
us a positive 4 we have a plus 7 so that
just stays positive 7 we have a negative
5 so that just stays negative 5 and we
have a plus 1 so that just stays
positive 1 so now we can move on to our
next step
our next step is we need to reflect all
the numbers along this red diagonal
which I'm drawing right now and if we
reflect all the numbers across this red
diagonal all the numbers that are
actually laying on that diagonal are
going to stay in the same position so
the numbers that are on the diagonal
negative 30 negative 50
and positive one they're gonna stay in
the same position negative 30 negative
15 and positive 1 and if we reflect the
number 18 and a number 25 along this red
diagonal then they're going to switch
places so this number 18 is going to go
where the 25 used to be and this number
25 is going to go where the number 18
used to be and if we reflect this number
7 and this number negative 5 across the
red diagonal then they're going to
switch places so the negative 5 is going
to go where the positive 7 used to be
and the positive 7 is gonna go where the
negative 5 used to be and I think you
get the idea by now if we reflect these
numbers across the red diagonal the
negative 5 and the positive 4 we're
going to switch places so the positive 4
is going to go where the negative 5 used
to be and the negative 5 is going to go
where the positive 4 used to be so now
we have completely found our new matrix
n and the nice thing about this matrix
is that it allows us to find the inverse
of our matrix a quite easily so I'm just
going to scroll down a little bit just
to give myself a little bit more space
so the formula for the inverse of our
matrix a is equal to 1 over the
determinant of a all multiplied by this
matrix n that we just found so we know
from earlier that the determinant of a
was 5 so 1 over the determinant of a is
going to be 1 over 5 and we know that
our matrix n is equal to negative 30 18
positive 7 so we have negative 30 18
positive 7 then we have 25 negative 15
negative 5 so we have 25 negative 15
negative 5 and we have negative 5 4
one negative five four and one and last
but not least this one over five is a
scalar so we need to multiply this by
the entire matrix so I'm going to scroll
down once again just to give myself a
little bit more space the inverse matrix
a is equal to one over five times
negative 30
which is negative 30 over 5 or negative
6 1 over 5 times 18 is just 18 over 5 1
over 5 times 7 is equal to 7 over 5 1
over 5 times 25 is 25 over 5 or just 5 1
over 5 times negative 15 is negative 15
over 5 or negative 3 1 over 5 times
negative 5 is negative 5 over 5 or just
negative 1 1 over 5 times negative 5 is
also negative 1 1 over 5 times 4 is 4
over 5 and 1 over 5 times 1 is just 1
over 5 so congratulations now we have
found the inverse of matrix a we've
probably spent over 10 minutes doing it
which a computer could probably do in
less than a second

Nildes the Morpheus that prophecy was
just another used control system
against them and that the destruction of
israel is something almost inevitable
however they do not have time to
reflect on your current situation
sentries group begin to be

abandon Nebuchadnezzar and to ce
be redeemed for nothing is destroyed
by sentries but thousand to suddenly
turns to adriane says something is

influences the objects in the simulated world

a copy of the program and smith
broadcast to the world through design
leaving the well next to your mind
greatest enemy which will have to defeat
matrix revolutions immediately starts
after the events of the second film as
result of his fight with the Sentinels
on returning to consciousness in a local
isolated in limbo in which
only capable of releasing sad
after threatening virgin number can
save thousand of 2 through its new
skills that actually the prophecy of
hole was correct
chosen must return to the source
stop the war however the architect
He changed the prophecy and forced
new predecessors end their
way to design destruction and
resumption of the matrix after a last
visit the oracle any learned that
not to worry about the guards
but with smith whose cloning is
multiplies and will not only conduct
fatal flaw matrix killing all
humans and the programs within it
and seriously damage the very
City of machines moreover
based on previous explanations
the oracle on the nature
I learned that the choice of storage
architect that his choice to
save the front would definitely
lead to the extinction of mankind was
incorrect
I also informed that now has the
power of choice and is aware that
You can end the war and defeat
smith and end the conversation
oracle that everything has a beginning
He has a child realizes that he must go to
the real source
in this case the machine city in
children to stop the sentinels smith
It is Daniel and the ship trinity long,
part towards what looks like a
suicidal trip the machine city

Nabucco dosul link Morpheus number 9
hummer tried to return to defense
now surrounded before the attack of
new machines and are trinity
surprised by the passenger
clandestine bn that left him blind but
much when you discover that he can still
turn a time of smith and in the case with
a kind of be the eye probably
granted by his powers thousand
taxpayers with a pilot guide wolves
the city's defenses but the brands
West with the beat in some logos
Any workout sections and seriously injure
the case in a great sound leaving the
alone to face in the city of
new machines is a machine whose
name is deus ex machina meaning
god from a machine and proposes a
peace between man and machine if it
stop smith
the offer is accepted enters the no
matrix for the last time and right away
smith realize that with worldwide
simulated
apparently the original smith fight
against new and seems to have finally
power achieved within the matrix
after the oracle in a transformed
of the clones thus earning their
powers and this time fighting the same
to - toe with the two engage nill
an apparent never ending battle to fight
catastrophic leaves the two in position
equality
as I could not defeat new
and while new realized he could not
win this battle with nothing to lose
31 with the death and everything to gain by
humanity and intentionally
sacrifices that sending smith win
between that smith pet thousand but
nilton added smith shows cracks in
neck and begins to explode and all
mit other snakes in the matrix do
same
eventually the virus is fully
eliminated from the matrix of this software
destruction process apparently
destroys smith and level of consciousness
also
but there are suspicions that a thousand have
survived because the machine sees
while his body is taken by
brands while rehearsing machines
interrupted his attack and sneaks in
Peace answer no purpose
and the peace
I had also negotiated any
human mind to become conscious
the nature of the matrix would be allowed
freedom without interference
just before the end of the film we see a
Black Cat in the year under a school
destroyed
this was an allusion to a scene newey
a black cat that appears twice in the
first movie
an indication that something has been
changed within the matrix code
for this was a new experience
jaú at the end follow a dialogue
between the architect
draco and then with the website where this
last question is summer again
worse matches that probably yes
Now yes then refresh the memory
you with three of the plot summary
movies
we begin to understand the universe
matrix that revolutionized cinema and
science fiction in many ways
teaching reference manga anime
comics cyber culture
punk philosophy kung fu among others
several references
now I begin to explain the universe
matrix of your world as it happened
as the machines got the domain and
etc
bora there in the world matrix
We know it is a virtual reality type
the second Sims life is logical or
that much more evolved
it's like everything you see now the
around your computer only cup
coffee did not exist to become more
course is like the same game
as I mentioned before you are living
in this game but without knowing
get an individual out of the matrix is
it will go through a period of
recovery
their bodies never used for the eyes
doyle muscles are atrophied
recovery takes on average one
week there for it uses the
culture that carry active musicians
It recovers in a few days to come and
leaving the mother a need
operator are the people who care
equipment while people
They are within it and provide all
type of equipment that people
will need
Furthermore the operator responsible for
find a way out for people who
you can dial a phone or telephone one
apartment close to where people
They are transmitted out of the matrix in
matrix agents are men
Field robots
they have a duty to maintain order
revoked to anyone who may be
considered a threat
But there are many agents
destruction during its
performance is very violent
agents have strength and agility
unusual is virtually
impossible to destroy them because they are the
while everyone and no car
explain each person inserted in the matrix
It may be the host of the season
agents because they do not have a body
fixed
just a person see something your ordinary
around which the system calls for us
it enters the body
agents can even disconnect from
shots they will have black and glasses
dark
as well as a small headset for
where they receive contacts from other agents
now I get a little bit of
history before the movies or be a
Style is prelude is on a date
not officially between 2000 and
2010
scientists have created the first
computer with consciousness was
started the intelligence was
Artificial thereafter is
evolution of computers has exploded with
own computers designing
new computers increasingly
intelligence were then created the
first robots with humanoid form
initially they were not alike
with humans but calls the same training
corporal
this time most of the thefts was
used in services that do not stop
Household to search
genetics
this time they were updating
its forms becoming increasingly
like humans arrived one
time when it is impossible to distinguish
a year of a robot that was then
They began the disputes between humans and
robots as robots are required
treated the same way that humans and
not only as mere machines
I work where it was to be a
advancing the finished with a kick
machines rebelled and deciding
enslave humans then began a
war on this war marks
lasted several years until close to his
end in a final act of desperation
humanity shut the sky so much
sun things that robots
used solar energy to recharge
but they ran out off the bad
not realized that he could
use humans as a source own
energy for intelligence
Artificial since the human body
It produces a lot of energy to overcome the hurts
war
this real world and imprisoned
all humans in cocoons where they
They had power they need for
goals while they are trapped
this kind of live a cocoon
virtual reality
when the last and final version of the
kills to be made it did not work
correctly to 1% of humans
They were edited it some
They survived and have a design city
thefts want to find any
cost to eliminate the last outbreak of
human resistance to madrid had
some versions before reaching their
final the architect created the first
beta matrix based on their
concepts of reality
the first version was a version
perfect which prevented human
tennis bad feelings to
avoid a simulated reality
bring suffering to 21 years
humans do not accept your world
perfect without pain and without war
the program collapsed and much
people died an architect then created
second beta of matrix in which the
virtual environment reflects
distorted and harmful characteristics
human thinking they so
accept the program
ie the law of another world
matrix only now with thoughts
and bad feelings like hatred sadness
and in some humans also not
accepted obvious to a world of pain and
war
the program collapsed in much
people died again
the architect failed and does not understand why
to see that the architecture is unable to
solve the problem alone deus ex
machina so that third movie
analyzed the problem the problem was that the
Architect does not understand users
program that is human
deus ex machina took the decision to
create a problem to solve this
problem
he created a program whose purpose
It was to understand the human mind
serve as an aid to helping architect
keep the array in working
This program was called hole
the Romans battery service was
I need to accept a virtual world
as being real with all its
forces
then the architect was at fault
create many who did not accept one
natural process of things human
the oracle studied humans and
He realized that all flow into a single
Score
the choices from this point forward to
fulfill its purpose it was necessary
where this time how to
processed human choices
the oracle found that values
mind of man as belief
experience and just get feelings
connected to the social environment of the person
always point to a choice that
so the oracle to realize that once
you may have control over the values
Mental person automatically
change one's choice shaping
choice of man would not
reason for humans choose
reject the matrix system as the
beta 1 and b2 only this
control would not be 100% effective the
beliefs experiences stories
life experiences connected to means
Social person does not always
determine human choice because
one like right there is no
standard not always a means Valdin
hundreds by regions because so
mental analysis of the oracle is not 100%
must say it was 99% and oracles
knew that these 11 percent who still
They insist on rejecting the main movie
also they have their experiences
feelings and since we did not realize
without citing mental characteristics
They were molded Automatically
future things these 1% of people
They will also be molded
this way would be extremely easy
for brands produce a system
virtual that supported these people
whose existence was too strong
provided that the following rules be
followed pressure and only humans now
They should have a constant reminder of
war against the machines have
aware that once were freed
the matrix or are children of people
who were delivered Israel should be a
rather unpleasant place believe in a
supreme being to direct
hopes
all characteristics forcing the
zion people that these habitats
israel would be if 1 percent
accept the new virtual system that is
design is hollow ruben ritual system
now will pay attention you will
understand
from that moment be any
human that threatens the virtual system
mentally be eliminated by sentinel
keeping the system balance with
more time
israel so it is not the physical world
is a virtual world is a layer
layer design is connected to the layer
matrix through the software interface
who want to protocol and password to
communicate these interfaces matrix
They are represented well by phone
as the design are presented by
cranial plug the problem with this is
that by the time the creators can
call it is not know how
program a system where there is the
while control beliefs
experiences and life stories
feelings while this
system would be computationally
predictable in order to prevent this
number 1% increase with time
deus ex machina then created a program
whose purpose is to answer this
question this program was called
Meruge first video realize that
computational stability dilemma
would be fully resolved if a
simple program was placed
in all simulations forward there
the first video postulated that teaches
causality in the system matrix
work of self-managed mode by
own human actions
considering that the oracle could
analyze the mental characteristics that
so a choice first video
analyzing the consequences of this
choice that would automatically lead the
new choices with new consequences
the system will automatically run
without external intervention
causality made it possible to know
the future since they had information
reliable primary choice in case the
algorithm of causality was added to
program oracle causing it
gained power to predict the future as
can process human choice to
well as assessing the
consequences of these choices
through these choices and so
successively
the program number video has become so
dispensable to have lost its
purpose in matrix programs
defects which lose their function should
They are sent to be the source
raised essentially non programs
They were created to make the choice
however the entire program has
human environmental characteristics by
example is to pray conclusion cookies and
puts black love right
mean they think like machines
even if they were virgin human number
then sneaks into the system and adopts
new purpose the new purpose the
first video is becoming a
dealer information as
dominates the understanding of causality
but the domain understanding the choices
human being so it becomes
Limited provide just the facts whose
choices have already been made
he then wanted a base with problems
outdated or defects, as well as
it should be deleted and boot
all information contained therein
for further analysis and that's why
he speaks in the third film
bring me oracle and I will give them their
savior because he needs her
humans are easy
certainly with time missed a
strength and will to live and pedro
logical hope
so the oracle had in mind that
zion people direct their
hopes in a supreme ie the
Time did not realize that if the people
design will be the messiah who also
It was a year and fight for freedom and
perform miracles in the system would have their
invigorated forces every day to
create the chosen
the oracle
what the output would be hired from
anomaly in human choice in one
talking point
the hope would be one of the forces
mental that shaped the choice of
israel population in the war
the machines from the moment it is
mental feature was a choice
then the inhabitants of Zion not
They made freely choose
so the choice had already been made
that is why it is called the new
chosen he has no choice
all schools have already been made and
You should just understand them and accept them
with this other issue raised as
leave that responsibility in the hands of
but one year but would never do that and how
design people and would deliver
responsibilities in the hands of a
machine obviously they did not
they do it
then the only way to solve the
impasse was to create a program exactly
a simulation program one year
calm so perfect but so perfect
that by itself would believe program
it was one year the program should
believe it would be the savior
hope and freedom that we
that is what the architect realizes
he continues and irrevocably
human because even after being able
performing the matrix thing no
year could even after
corrupting the binary code of a
agent
even after clearly feel the
causality flow to states that 30
I would take a shot
I remember the dreams several times had
type functions forecasts still right
so he does not feel a program it
still I felt a year and was scheduled
out that way even the chosen
He worked the whole story for
machines unknowingly helping to shape
choices of the people but not design
Works chosen was much more
complex than that unlike
matrix in which people were conceived
Artificially keeping a control
population with the size of the machines
the site a problem for inhabitants
getting through sex
making it impossible to control by
machines
sooner or later Israel pull the error
radio that is needed to madrid
to stay connected
constant action was necessary
so the population of israel
reached the limit population
so the other function is a thousand
return to the source of his Semna
programming and re-enter the program
original
after that choose 23 people said
seven males used to rebuild the
to install array to the next
version to a tribe is in its sixth
official version which leads to complete
that there be six sessions the matrix
selected
ie there were six formatting of
design solutions which gives more
sure wish is virtual with
you really think brands
destroyed the year six times for logo
then rebuild it all over again
this fits with the predictions
uttered with your that there was a
man inside the matrix could do
amazing things and freed the
first human saying that one day would
come back
which is exactly what the architect
says for me to do
He followed refused the choice of such
people would no longer be formatted without
chance of being rebuilt and matrix
main break and causing the
humanity disappear at the end of the 1st
3
the agent was corrupt punished missing
its purpose and are consequently
forced to return to the source to be
deleted
so in my video displays fled to
within the system and took on a new
the purpose to convey destruction
matrix dominated he would have full access
the interfaces to access the site already
They wanted also part of
simulation ie it was not for the
real world as liu does not exercise
influence on brands in the world
only in the simulation but this was not
God's concern ex machina to
call zahia was not the main
problem is the main problem is that
smith would have been directly and that all
Programs related to matrix
ie the software in the real world
including true deus ex own
Machina which is connected to the matrix and
attackers
ie is not about saving where zaire
smith was about the maximum same mistake
two brands
smith could easily complete
his goal was not achieved the
caused mutation punished at the end of
first film allowed smith
making it impossible to evolve
isolate it this one way track
Matrix program able to defeat
smith would be a thousand
knowing that smith was out of control and
the program was able to defeat it new
deus ex machina makes a deal with 1000
for peace in Israel a cylinder
smith simply a copy instead of
new union programming code
continues in both autonomously maria
it means the same time that it
matt smith is not destroyed in this
occasion no later than the collapse
machine then takes the residue thereof
ground and month that Balsom and lead to
a basic concept right after all is not
needed for the near future and
System boot is another thing I found
Interestingly, even after
rise of the machines for the second
film shows that humans still
You have to use them type as shown
the scene in what happens in the design where
a machine control water and other
creates oxygen kind needed for
our survival
we have control over the machines
but the same exercise the same control
about Us
if we hung in die this
years to kill them stop working by
lack of energy is a source matrix and
analogy with Christianity right
there is a benign Trinity movie
30 comprises means Trinity
English showed in my dreams
Greek mythology he plays john
the Baptist preparing the way for the
chosen and the god father
to take the father figure of all
They have been freed illusion and niu niu
in the case would be chosen a replacement
for jesus cristo in the first apparition
the new logo we know what will be the
their role in the environment choe trilogy
of new arrived new court with some
friends to pay and receive a
order he thanks a way that
It becomes almost a prophecy about the
its future hallelujah you my savior
face my personal jesus cristo in
first film in the series to more than ten
references aneel as a voter or
chosen in matrix reloaded perceive
nil when out of the elevator in the city
design and approached by people from various
age groups
many with oriental features and bringing
only the hands and 30 saying they
They need you you're not wanted
reputable and a savior best friend
this is one of the subtle messages that
Technology goes in their lines
however the main message
technology is a new concept of
truth in a dialogue asks me what
It is matrix answers you want to know
the matrix that madrid is in all
range is a world that believes to be real
so he did not realize the truth
true that you are a new slave
like everyone else you were born in
in captivity in a prison not
can see that smell to play a
prison to his mind when he goes
consult the oracle meets boy
with Buddhist costumes who can play
spoon without touching them
the boy that should not bend the spoon
it will not be possible
instead just try to realize the
true question that it is true that
there is no needle is not welcome
There the boy responds then you see
it is not the spoon that bends only
you seem to matrix the truth is that
everything is him even a very brief form
is the depreciation and unanimism
death sense the absence of
response to the purpose CUC trilogy
matrix without doubt one of the largest
movies right
It may not be the best but it is among
they certainly obviously has
flaws and holes happen yet
once that my mother has a
depth gante but steps aside
when we got the depth of
things are presented to us in
plot of the three films only philosophy
reference for example the story with
certainly one of the best and the fact
it is complex is just smart
general understanding already getting hard
many people do not really understand
first film leaving aside
other two but it is only good in my
view the first film will always be
but others also deserve better
congratulations
good guys and the moçada hope
I hope you have enjoyed tanned
more videos volume in the same style
You are always looking for films
were that were difficult
general understanding
We seek with intelligent plots and
complex to be able to explore more and
choose your fans that were difficult
go out to the general understanding beauty
then this is it even worth talked
hug and goodbye
Mr. Anderson, welcome back.
We missed you.
You like what I've done with the place.
It ends tonight.
I know it does, I've seen it.
That's why the rest of me is just gonna enjoy the show.
Cause we already know that I'm the one who beats you.
Can you feel it Mr.Anderson.
Closening in on you.
Who I can.
I really should thank you for it after all it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life.
Purpose of life is to end.
[Music]
and then guys my name is Renan and I did
the analysis of the film matrix right
based on archetypal symbols and
everything else are things I like
It is important but the audience also asked
do analysis on the issue of
architect is you do not understand the part
Architect you do not understand anything in
movie you did not understand the film
Also I will make a
Movie explanation you look on
Internet has several explanations well
cool too but I imagine friends
do it here also for you
better understand the film and make some
interesting comments also that the
full team and so when I see the movie
then the complexity of the film is based
the feature came up with the ana
architect
let's see who asks for you to see
that year came up with science
moleano computer is a data type
primitive that has two values
They can be regarded as zero or one
true or false
ie there is no middle ground for
Lion system is either a 10 or
yes and no good or bad
the architect is very good he leandro
want perfect things
you and I maybe can not see
beyond our options but that
Man can not have my any
why not choose he does not understand
They were not for him choices are
variable something one one each
variable must be solved after
computer is the purpose of making the
balanced equation
What is your purpose
the architect as many think it is not
a person who created the matrix
it is the world's software program
the machines well before the matrix
existed two beta versions of matrix
architect with the logic of the first
beta version
he created a very Boleyn reality
so perfect
only this version in Portuguese
was the mano service had feeling
bad to avoid a simulated reality
that comes suffering and human aldo
the first matrix I designed almost
perfect course was a work of
reaped art among others sublime
only equaled to his monumental
failure
humans do not accept your world
perfect painlessly and then win
program or collapse many people died
then thinking Boleyn mind the architect
concluded that humans would rather the world
which reflected their intentions
so he created a second version
Beta System
thinking that they would accept the program
this second beta repeat
harmful distanced features
humans the inevitability of
your end
it is apparent to me now as
result of imperfection and yet
all human beings
so I designed based on our
story to reflect more thorough
mind the qualities of the grotesque
human nature
but then again I frustrated me with
failure and human again not
They accepted their grotesque world of pain
war
the program collapse again and many people
died
then the machines create another
program that was not as straight as
architect they created a program whose
purpose is to understand the mind from the
human users in the event and serve
helps the architect helping to maintain
registration in good working
this program called oracle from
then I realized that the answer me
He eluded because I wanted a mind less
intelligent or perhaps a mind - that
captures the parameters of perfection
the response was accidentally discovered
by an intuitive programming
initially set up to investigate
certain aspects of the human mind
if I am the father of her without matrix
doubt if the mother
the oracle found that for the
human had battery was need
affected the virtual world as time
real soon straw architect was
here there is not much to facilitate
natural protest of human choices
human choices are not so
deterministic logic or much less
goianos how machines
so the architect has very goiano
not properly understand the choice of
Bro
so the film it on my this as
systemic anomaly as independent
system modeled since there
humans present it work
form voids or it is not Boleyn
compared to the system only comprises
machines
choose the problem is choice
the oracle studied humans and
He realized that all flow into the single
then point the choices to meet
its purpose was inevitable that the
oracle understand the modules
complete some human choices
the oracle found that values
environmental human
as belief experiences stories
life and feelings connected to the means
social person always points to a
choose this way we will never be free
to choose anything for such mental value
always in the concierge very proud
you already know if I'll accept I do not
I know dating you not only this but if
you already know how I can decide whether
We did not come here to make a decision
you've decided you're here
try to understand their decision
I thought I already know it now
thus realized that an oracle
time may have control over
monthly values of the person as beliefs
experiences and life stories
feelings connected to the social environment
automatically change the choice of
person
changing the choice of the human being not
would be no reason for humans
reject ie choose and reject
system rejects the matrix as in the two
betas past versions
only that this control would not be 100%
effective experiences of beliefs and
life stories and feelings
connected to the social environment of the person or
done and determine human choice
so the mental analysis of the oracle
is made not made need it
accidentally find a solution
nearly 99% of all human
accepted program as tested
raise a school
even if you were aware of that choice
level of unconsciousness
the oracle knew this percentage
people still insisted on rejecting
a major system also have
their experiences and feelings that is
people were more rules than others
people in their choices then created
zion romão within the matrix atrix
so people's choices
They are molded in a way that still
more subtle
so the machines produced a
another virtual system that supports
those people whose anomaly was more
hard to complete the situation
these people remaining the system
for they should always have a
constant reminder of the war on
machines
the system for it should also have
always aware that one day this
freed from the matrix or people who are
children of people who have been freed
ASAE or should be also a place
rather unpleasant
and they should also have a system
beliefs should believe is a being
Supreme directed to waiting
then with all the features
They would then use to accept a nerd
new virtual system because these
features destroy anomaly
systemic
so from that moment any
human system that threatens
Virtual mentally and versions
betas be eliminated by sentries
keeping the system balance by
more time
zion so it is not the physical world
with many think
israel is a virtual world with a matrix
within the matrix can see it in
connections they make through
software interface that requires
password protocols to communicate
this interface in the matrix was
represented by phone as it appears
in the film as well as israel são
those represented by the club
Ukrainian who also appears in the film
but to program a system where there
while control of believers
experiences and life stories
feelings while this
system is computationally
predictable in order to avoid these
three people are anomalies
then the machines constantly create
a program whose purpose was
answer that question
This program was called , and the mail
video Merovingian realized the dilemma
computational stability would
fully resolved if put
simple programming code
all enrollments forward there
the first video postulated to enter the
causality matrix in what one
action takes a more action
the system work autonomously
for their actions because of man
the hole can analyze the
mental characteristics how a
choice and video homer analyzed the
consequences of this choice
automatically take new choices
with new effects
so we would be managed
automatically without
external intervention causality
made known in advance
any deterministic event within
the matrix that is to know the future
since it had primary data
confident that in the case are the choices
then the quality of the algorithm was
placed on the program by oracle
her to gain more power
Extraordinary system
the power to predict the future as
can process human choice and
same time analyzes
consequences of these choices
through these choices so
Merovingian program becomes obsolete
to have lost its purpose in matrix
faulty programs or have lost
its function must be sent to the bridge
to be deleted
essentially the programs were not
created to make choices
however the programs are made to
act in a human world with
mental characteristics of human
kitchen and example of the oracle
stuff
he even says that puts love in
cookies that might a choice
unpredictable machines in case
placing human characteristics to
programs endangerment causes
that much of the choice programs
flee into the system instead
returning to the source to be
deleted
and that it was me the video makes it
sneaks into the system and adopts
new purpose of its new purpose
It is to be a dealer information
since it dominates the understanding of
quality but the name on the understanding
of human choices
therefore it becomes limited him
can not predict the facts about
choices that have been made
he can only deal
information that you know that
they are concrete
he then creates a based programs
Suitable or defect as well as
it should be brought to fountain
to take the information to be
avoided but this procedure is very
effective and that's why he spends
whole trilogy looking oracle bring
brown eyes
I will return them to their savior
humans give up easily and
certainly with time they lost strength
and the will to live
lost hope so the
oracle had in mind that
design inhabitants direct your
16 hope for the prize that is by
akon realized that the design people had
mixed up who was also human and
fought for freedom and realities
miracles
so the people would have their system
hope refreshed every day
then to create the chosen oracle
the solution was determined that
focus all mana anomaly choice
a single point of failure hope
It would be one of the mental forces
would shape the choice of the population
design in the war against the machines
From the moment that is characteristic
mental formula will then choose the
doctor did not make that choice
freely so the choice had
It has been made and that is why it is not
called the chosen you did not come
here to make a decision that is
decide is here to try to understand
his decision to leave such
responsibility in the hands of one year
the machines would never do that and how
daegu of people would deliver
responsibility in the hands of a machine
obviously they did not do that
soon control name
the only way to resolve the impasse was
create a program that simulates human
so perfectly but so perfect
he even believe firmly be
human
the program itself should believe
it would be the savior
hope and freedom that people
that is what the architect realizes
he continues and irrevocably
human although the process has changed
his conscience and continues
irrevocably mano because even
then you are able to perform registration
something that no human could ever
even after breaking the code
a torque agent
even after clearly feel the
quality flow to pv
the bullet that would take 30 and still
he does not feel a program
he still felt like a human and was
designed to make that way the
oracle also determined that the
solution would be to make this point
single fault is expertly
commanded to carry out the ideal choice
for machines
the chosen work history
whole for the machines
You know helping to change the choice of
rings but was chosen due to the
much more complex here differently
the matrix in which people were
designed artificially keeping
population control by the
machines even with the weather
broken system
the air matrix was freer because
managed children through sex
making it impossible to control by
of the machines on a time scale
bigger but still later registration
online would pull more hardware resources
than in the matrix then it was necessary
one end formed as a constant that
israel population reach the
population limit
although this response will work
obviously it is fundamentally speaking this
creating a form diverting condition
a systemic anomaly contradiction
which if not corrected would threaten the
own system
ergo those who refused Program
although in the minority if not corrected
be a likely time
greater disaster
it is design you are here
because leave is about to be
destroyed
all its inhabitants disposed of
its total existence eradicated
bullshit
denial is more predictable the
human responses but being rested
this will be the sixth time that we see in
become extremely efficient at it
so another new function was
think the main computer whenever
It was already formatted to
install the matrix and choose the people
to rebuild a dream for the next
version as we have seen the brand that is
his sixth official version which brings us
the conclusion that there were three versions
officers matrix there were six chosen
there were six formats ie
destruction which gives more certainty
that would use virtual or even believe
the machines destroyed already made
for it soon after destroyed
again and it was just dumb machines
robertinho function is chosen
now return source allowing
temporary designation code
you carry reinserting the program
Main after which you will be
asked the selected matrix 23
individuals
women and seven men to rebuild
salary that fits with the predictions
by matheus pronounced that there was a
man tries the matrix could do
amazing things and releasing the
first humans and seeing that one day would
back and is exactly what the architect
He said to me you will not let
to happen need humans
to survive levels
survival we are prepared
to accept
however , the important question
you are prepared does not pass the
responsibility for the death of each
week in this world defined refuse
gather people
the matrix break sooner or
late as I had said before making
that humanity would disappear
smith agent was corrupted by thousand
at the end of matrix or losing their
purpose and are consequently
forced to vote to have the source
deleted
as well as my video and others
programs that do not return the source
smith fled into the system
and also took on a new purpose the
purpose of the destruction seen with
dominated the whole matrix
he would have full access to the interfaces
to cezar zani virus type 1 man
who are malicious programs that
By automatically relay
infecting computers connected all
but that was not the concern of
machines
the ozone layer is not the primary
problem is the main problem is that
I would even be direct with en all
problems linked to the matrix
this is the real world the same software
so the software of the machines that
own machines use to create the
matrix that is was not about saving
zaine smith was on the machines
save yourself as a whole to the
real world
smith could easily complete
your goal if not thousand
accordingly the only program
matrix able to defeat the measures
would thousand
because if the purpose belie
the destruction of the new era
reconstruction making them opposed
each other than he
it is its opposite you
your goal the result of equation
I have so many balance then
machines to make a deal with 1000 in
exchange for peace with Israel would be destroyed
smith and so peace reigned in the two
virtual environments being one smith
reverse copy opposite Nilceu
union programming code
continuous in both self nullify
because the sum of opposite charges is equal
to zero and not write it thanks to
power that robbed him of the oracle and
despairs
nilce is death at the same time
this matt smith
nil is not destroyed on this occasion in
most he collapsed
then the machine takes his
information and leads to a cleaning
new after all it is necessary for the future
and next boot of the system
[Music]
to those who watched the entire trilogy and
Animatrix see that responsible for
create all this complication were the
humans themselves
it shows that humans create a
potential new fractal matrix called
AI was one
technological singularity that became
confines
that is their own creation
They turned against themselves
in a video posted here on the channel
talking about technology imitating
life gives you an idea of
more or less what I mean
and also it shows that it is possible
there are numbers level matrix
capital
this is the moment of infinite matrix
doctrine created one inside the other
it was this analysis and explanation
also I hope you like it
who liked the premiere on the channel
I will soon do more analysis and then

The Matrix is a system neo that system
is our enemy when you're inside we look
around what do you see businessmen
teachers lawyers carpenters the very
minds of the people we are trying to
save but until we do these people are
still a part of that system
and that makes them our enemy have to
understand most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged and many of them
are so nerd' so hopelessly dependent on
the system that they will fight to
protect it
are you listening to me neo or were you
looking at the woman in the red dress I
was look again please it this this isn't
the matrix No
it's another training program designed
to teach you one thing if you are not
one of us you are one of them
what are they sentient programs they can
move in and out of any software still
hardwired to their system that means
that anyone we haven't unplugged is
potentially an agent inside the matrix
they are everyone and they are no one
we are survived by hiding from them by
running from them but they are the
gatekeepers they are guarding all the
doors they are holding all the keys
which means that sooner or later someone
is going to have to fight them someone I
won't lie to you new every single man or
woman who has stood their ground every
one who has fought an agent has died but
where they have failed you will succeed
why I've seen an agent punch through a
concrete wall men have emptied entire
clips at them and hit nothing but air
yet their strength and their speed are
still based in a world that is built on
rules because of that they will never be
as strong or as fast if you can be what
are you trying to tell me that I can
dodge bullets no neo I'm trying to tell
you that when you're ready you won't
have to
we got trouble
you ever watched the movie one of the matrix
characters live a reality
fantasy constructed by computers
and that in fact the real world presents
a much more cruel reality and
perverse than they can imagine this
film that really a transmutation
the myth of the cave good plato see
them with huge gogol saying the name
Beatriz is marly so it can not
be happening for example'm not
a guy hairy talking to my name is
great because what matters is not what
you observe what it is
subjective fantasy of each
especially sexually
this sexual fantasy should overlap
his perception of reality and this
is all over the real world you
notes you think you are kidding
but this is very serious and red
notes that the fact that simply
They want paulo priest about it in
your head is your head and
Watch the lecture with attention I do not
I am a Catholic last video where
I did about the pedophile priests
is speaking ill of Protestants
music're badmouthing his clan the
people fail to understand more
what it is said what was said
worth what people mean by
distorted through a mindset that
drought is not hard to understand
worth what I said what the
one understands within college
that is what the battle is my
law professor friend is not
any right of shit in the area and the
guy will explain to you what is good anyway
are more than ten hours of video
at 10 hours plus a shitload of books
They will take at least one
in your life right now is you want
red pill still continue with
his fantasy world
you want the blue pill you will have
to go through an ordeal for
understand the reality that certainly
just like in the film matrix when
he chooses that blue pill begins
suffering is to be purged of
cables it needs to go through a period
adaptation of understanding why
never walked in his life and never felt the
things as they are just that
offering for you and this
perception of reality as it is only
It comes through knowledge you will
behind that knowledge will prefer
keep watching the reality that
about the way it is presented and
presents totally distorted by
subjective perceptions of each
individuals who aim to take
an end of class struggle be it
which fo the red pill blue pill
you choose
laws on this occasion'm going to
teach an interesting scene
matrix
when one reaches the end and knows the
architect of the matrix such that it is not
other than the demiurge chief hierarch
Archons have created farms
prison
then tells Leo that it is a gas
that is an anomaly in the system
because because we are being scheduled
to follow a guideline for online
they follow a path that we have
marked
by mind control in this
prison farm
then who leaves pastureland matrix
who came out of that mind control and
Yoke jump comes face
him to escape this matrix is
then when the baby is a
anomaly
[Music]
everything is mathematically controlled
the mentality Beehive
Archons and his team for all
its size
all employees who work
by the Archons for control
Prison farms matrix over already
been many people who have left
lamas has also tried to leave
matrix and have failed to humans
They have been those who have connected to
the original source if they have reached
the center of the problem
until that precisely Archon all
Sunday controls
many to discover all this
manipulation reacts in a manner
aggressive reaction in a manner
[Music]
rebels want to reveal the system
They want to attack want to destroy it
but that is not the end because they
control all
the military police or even
demonstrations
what they want is your reveal
to do is chaos for them after
treated with the solution for them then
and we offer the solution but
destroy all rebelliousness caused
on the farm prison without changes
statements
every time I have seen more than others
rear times or several rebellions
you shall rejoice in danger without food
on the farm presións they have
booked again to the program
system by disasters by
destruction is global to
reset it and start again
they control both sides of the
light on the side that looks good as
side so that control over all
in this prison farm
they have their infiltrated agents is
infiltrates within groups
default within the group
and call release by the
kind of fooling with false
light and introduced into the same
arconte dimension array to
do not go back again to the
principle be eliminated
nothing them every time they see
endanger food whenever they see
searching for many people on the farm
prison
many souls are being released created
an almost mass destruction to return
to repopulate the farm prison again
the entire planet to reset what is
just as they have done they have done
with several ancient civilizations
They had a great legacy system
technology and technological system
They had a great high advances
spiritual
then there were existed confrontations
confrontations between humans
enslaved and the Archons if
controllers
thus they destroyed everything in
those occasions during those hours and returned
to reschedule the farm again

Hello everyone welcome to Let us free ourselves
Matrix
Following this history of science
fiction we saw in the previous chapter
as United States and binding
Soviet reached an agreement
implanting capitalism in the world is
ie the law of the jungle applied the
economy
with this the illuminati and finally
They advancing towards globalization and
gained ground to implement its so
awaited new world order coming
looking for the last many decades
back and they had not been able to realize
thanks to the brake imposed by the
Brotherhood members Dragon
white key had learned that
to halt plans well and an
I just had to re-tight
brotherhood of the white dragon but
also had to infiltrate their
members in key positions of power
in order to curb the dark plans
the illuminati and so far it
He had succeeded
however nu and with the help lille
from the television
They knew they could implant the idea
New world order
collective unconscious and thus
create at will that reality
the above they promoted through
books like george orwell 's 1984 or
a happy world of Aldous hook or leigh
through comics and stories
Hollywood science fiction
however they realized that these
media did not reach
many people but only a
few and thus had no
I managed to implement this idea in the
collective unconscious of most
so his goal was not reached
but now culminate TV
in full swing was different now
They could promote this idea through
Subliminal messages hidden and
thereby implant the idea in a big
number of people without their knowledge
account
so they soon announce the
world
but and in January 1991 shortly
after the start of war
Gulf used against a puppet
controlled Illuminati called
george bush which was president of
United States at that time and
he used a speech chain
where national heralded the beginning
NWO year and lille
They estimated that it would be implemented in
seven or nine years later than
However the actions of the Dragon
White did not allow
or at least not entirely wars or
Undercover sacrifices are guided by
everyone and human farm was
feeding the bracos ian one aguirre
pilar us for 1997
today from insects they had already
I finished extracting resources
natural they needed for their
planet
they had a peace pact with
Draconian after the Great War
Galactic in which participated without
But jeopardizing the treaty
of peace
Uras go far from land
they only pretended to go to the
students kiss but not suspect
They left several of their species
infiltrators and hidden among humans
Russia and continued to exchange
knowledge and technology with them
so they could compete in the future
for being the first world power and
power and wrest control of the
human farm their students here
Ungar desperate illuminati because
They failed to implant a new
order were preparing a big blow
to create a third war
world that will guarantee them control
Total world
advised by a nu in 2001
They decided to attack the plus symbol
significant in the global economy
the World Trade Center disguised as a
They predicted that false flag
This blow is going to be and
to wreak havoc for necessary
would create a new scale war
world
however it was not the dragon
White acted quickly and did not allow
most nations take
match this attack
In addition inspectors also
Russia advised not to take sides and
they were sure it was a
lozanne one trick of xa gal
even though this attack generated a
wave of fear throughout the world and
significantly increased the
negative energies captured by the
bracos in Lille they were no longer really
surprised that humanity
I was getting tired of wars without
But they did not give up and the
lille occurred to him that now
new sacrifices
besides war disguise it also
They would be disguised as terrorism and
He instructed his chosen people to
financed more attacks across the
world
911 was not only a date
He changed the course of history and
implanted fear in the world but
It was also used as a
experiment to see if the
collective unconscious helped create
reality much faster since
This event was announced encrypted
mind before several
series films and cartoons and go
who succeeded in doing with this
the illuminati and were able to measure the
effectiveness hidden messages
implanted into the subconscious
collective for later
become reality
since then the bombing
media of these messages will
the rise since they know very well that
collective thinking can change the
reality at will at the beginning of the year
2000 new technologies flooding
the world and particularly promoted
by white dragon he became
what hope and help
awakening of humanity once and for
all that technology was the internet
with her that thought
television and counter
begin transmitting messages
contrary to the awakening of the
conscience of humanity though
refine and became popular
in the world he took a few years
gradually this medium was the only
which could talk about what
really it is happening in the world
It was thanks to the internet people
they knew of the secret lodges
They govern the world behind the scenes and
dark plans to implement the new
world order
ultimately began the slow
awakening of humanity when the
lille and anush realized that the
Internet opposed his plans
They began to try to control it
they knew they had left little
time to carry out their plans and
the second wave of shock
consciously prepared by Jesus from the
fifth dimension was about
reach the ground and were afraid
that their plans had materialized us
by then
so they began using the people
chosen one
and the illuminati and all its loggias
secret to accelerate its objectives and
once and for all implementing its new
order but we'll see in the
Reptilian final chapter of the Matrix

Ashley
a Hollywood blockbuster represents
thousands of hours of work which means
that no matter how great the finished
product some pretty interesting stuff
happens behind the scenes of most films
that we the public never get to hear
about except on super cool YouTube
videos like this one here's a look at
the filming of The Matrix franchise and
some of the crazy things that happened
when the cameras weren't rolling
required reading matrix star Keanu
Reeves had to read a thousand pages
worth of philosophy and evolutionary
psychology before he was even allowed to
see the complete script for the film but
everyone in the cast had a homework
assignment to read a dense book of
French postmodern philosophy called
simulacra and simulation by Jean
Baudrillard that's because the film's
directors the Wachowski z-- wanted to be
sure that everyone in the movie really
understood the concept behind the matrix
and could explain it when asked
unlike Morpheus who clearly didn't do
the reading unfortunately no one can be
told what the matrix is you have to see
it for yourself the scene Warner
Brothers didn't want you to see the
matrix special effects team studied
everything from the physics of fluid
dynamics to the exploding patterns of
different types of glass in order to
create this awe-inspiring helicopter
crash
but the whole thing almost didn't happen
just researching the scene took so much
time money and work that Warner Brothers
tried to have it cut from the movie
entirely
fortunately the Wachowski is passion one
out in the helicopter crash stayed in
using just about every kind of special
effect available at the time the matrix
was a comic before it was a movie before
they blew your mind with this breakout
sci-fi hit directing duo the Wachowski
's had only one other successful film to
their name the lesbian crime drama bound
so to convince Warner Brothers to fund
the matrix they got comic artists Geof
Darrow and Steve's gross to turn the
script into a shot-for-shot storyboard
of the entire film the 600 page
storyboard was impressive enough to get
the studio to take the red pill giving
the Wachowskis a 60 million dollar
budget to make their vision a reality
Warner Brothers only stipulation that
they got to pick the film's star though
their choice of Keanu Reeves wasn't
initially a big hit with the Wachowskis
turns out they just didn't know Reeves
had a skill set that went way beyond
what they'd seen in Bill &amp; Ted's
Excellent Adventure all the white shirts
were actually green if you noticed that
every scene set inside the matrix
simulation is kind of green and queasy
looking you're not imagining things it
was a visual trick used by the
filmmakers to give the world a sterile
artificial feel which sure they could
have accomplished with a filter in
post-production but costume designer Kim
Barrett went the extra mile and put
every light colored piece of clothing
worn by the cast through a green wash
that also goes extra nicely with the
color scheme in the oracles kitchen
The Matrix took its casting director to
some interesting places for neo this
training simulation was designed to
teach him to keep an eye out for the
movie's evil agents but if you take
Morpheus as advice you'll notice
something weird some of the people in
this crowd look exactly alike for the
filmmakers it was a subtle hint that
whoever made this simulation took
shortcuts copying and pasting the same
code multiple different times but for
casting director Tim little it was a
challenge because he was the one who had
to scour the entire country of Australia
for dozens of pale skinned twins and
triplets to use in the scene that wasn't
the best part of the job however little
actually had the most fun visiting local
fetish clubs to find extras who would be
comfortable in
some of the films more extreme costume
options the matrix recycles back in the
day the sets constructed for the Matrix
Reloaded and the Matrix Revolutions were
among the most ambitious ever built like
the one and a half mile stretch of fake
highway that was built from scratch for
this chase scene but it didn't go to
waste
97.5 percent of the materials used in
the final two Matrix movies were either
recycled or repurposed to build
low-income housing in Mexico which means
that someone is probably sitting in a
living room right now where the very
walls are imbued with molecules of Keanu
Reeves kung-fu sweat Hugo Weaving
epiphany one of the best parts of the
Matrix Reloaded is the burly brawl where
Neel battles an army of clones of the
evil agent Smith this scene was
partially accomplished through CGI but
it was mostly done by making up a herd
of stuntmen to look just like actor Hugo
Weaving
and unfortunately this awesome movie
moment shattered any illusions weaving
had about his receding hairline talk
about a bad way to find out that you're
going bald Keanu Reeves gave away a lot
of matrix money despite what you may
have heard Keanu Reeves didn't donate
his entire salary to the movie special
effects crew but he did sign away his
residual payments forever in order to
funnel money back into the trilogy's
production nobody knows exactly how much
money Reeves passed up in order to give
the crew another two movies worth of job
security but it would have been in the
millions we'll give you a second to let
that sink in
he's the one

supercrack Star presents the sun
nigeria flashes very strange event
failures in our reality matrix that
shows that our whole world can
be a simulation
this news has only six days
October this year 2017 the sun
He did things he has to do
sun flashes in nigeria in 2012
Also in this country nigeria Could
see a floating city in the sky
I say everything supercrack star
this has to do with celebrities
chemtrails and for that we need
remember a story a few years ago
which features this country
nigeria and chemtrails planes
chemtrails were forced to land
in india and nigeria
Russian military analysts are
reporting today that the kremlin
military forces of the United States
They are in panic landings
forced ordered by forces
Air India and nigeria two
Ukrainian aircraft have operated 124
by the US Air Force and
based on their giant secret

Chinese officials are warning
it is an American attempt
European carrying out a genocide in

h1n1 swine flu that has
endanger the entire world population
I personally supercrack star
I think seeing things that happen in
nigeria with the sun would have the mission
to hide the reality matrix
the first of these aircraft is
forced to land continue
these reports was on the
Indian when an airplane operated 124
the United States changed its sign

that triggered an immediate response
Air Force of India and have
She forced him to land in bombay and
second he was forced down by a
Nigerian fighter jet then
They arrested both crew to

strangest of these reports
presented by agencies
Indian intelligence and nigeria
on these aircraft more than
carrying arms were his

They say could be more than 45,000
100.000 pounds and kilograms of

nigeria however had to be
forcibly persuaded to release the

initial refusal to do so suffered

They are operating in that country since
this happened in the mysterious nigeria

take chemtrails stopped in nigeria and
since then amazing things happen
in nigeria as the flashing sun
floating cities seen in your skies
for the many and conflicting issues
surrounding these queues chemicals not

someday you want a star
I wake up where the clouds are
behind me where the laughs fall

If happy little bluebirds become more
Beyond the rainbow
